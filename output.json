He worked to protect undocumented students, decreased teacher turnover, increase graduation rates across the district for Black, Latino and Pacific Islander students, secured the financing and identified a site for our first affordable housing units for educators, and fought to make sure that Mission Bay will have its first school built in the next few years.READ MORE"

The problem facing our schools is not a lack of students, but rather a lack of investment, quality programs, and equitable resource distribution. District leadership has consistently shifted its focus away from equity, neglecting the schools most in need of support.",
            "Now, in the face of a fiscal crisis, it\u2019s our schools in District 10 that are being sacrificed to balance the budget. This is a grave injustice, and it\u2019s time we call it out.",
            "People claim that the recent recalls were about focusing on students. But I ask: which students? Does this feel like the district is truly prioritizing the needs of all students?",
            "Since the recalls, we've witnessed an exodus of staff, unresolved payroll issues, declining student enrollment with families leaving the district, and now, we face a budget crisis with the threat of state takeover.",
            "In light of these concerns, I cannot support school closures at the expense of my community. Our students and families deserve better. We deserve better.",
            "For these reasons, I will be asking the school district to postpone these closures until a more thorough assessment of their impact on students can be conducted."

District 8 includes the Castro, Glen Park, Noe Valley, Diamond Heights, Mission Dolores, and Cole Valley. Supervisor Mandelman is one of the LGBTQ members of the Board of Supervisors, and throughout his first term, was one of the only LGBTQ Supervisors in Northern California.READ MORE",
            "Happy Stairway Month, District 8!It\u2019s sunny, it\u2019s block party and street fair season, and it\u2019s been great to see many of you out and about in the district. As usual, we\u2019ve been busy!LGBTQ History MuseumOn October 1st, the Mayor and I introduced legislation to acquire the building at 2280 Market Street between Noe and Sanchez to be used as a permanent home for the LGBTQ History Museum! The road to this point has been a long and winding one. We looked at a number of sites, entered into several letters of intent, requested appraisals of multiple buildings, negotiated with various owners, had our hopes raised and dashed at different points.This journey began more than fifteen years ago, when then-Supervisor Bevan Dufty struck the deal that allowed the GLBT Historical Society to open a museum space in the Castro. Although that space has been a great success and a destination for visitors to the Castro and neighborhood residents alike, we have all known for some time that it would not be the museum\u2019s forever home. Beginning in 2021, Mayor Breed set aside funds in each year\u2019s budget to be used for a permanent home for an LGBTQ history museum befitting San Francisco\u2019s role in the story of queer liberation, culture and politics.Former Supervisor and now State Senator Scott Wiener found $5.5 million in State funding to help make initial improvements to the building and give the GLBT Historical Society a solid start on the private fundraising required to sustain and grow the museum\u2019s operations in the future.Currently we anticipate that the building will be operated in partnership with the GLBT Historical Society and the Community Arts Stabilization Trust, a nonprofit that specializes in supporting cultural nonprofits in the acquisition and operation of real estate assets. Our hope is that in time the GLBT Historical Society will be able to acquire the building from the City, but until that point it will operate the museum under a lease.There is still lots of work to do to close on the property, get the second floor ready for the museum and see the museum open and operating, but it is most exciting to have made it this far.SF Stairway Month and Burnside StepsOne of the fun parts of this work is that we get to celebrate neighborhood beautification projects and citywide civic involvement. This month, we had the chance to do both!You may be familiar with theBurnside Muralin Glen Park and the effort to create a tiled staircase there, led by the relentless Renee Berger (Renee was profiled in our July \u201cFaces in the Crowd\u201d segment). After a long, meandering, and frankly painful journey through our city\u2019s regulatory \u201capproval\u201d process, tiles are being installed this month. Head out to 50-59 Burnside Avenue to see the work in progress and come for the ribbon cutting on October 27 to see San Francisco\u2019s newest tiled staircase!With the impending completion of the Burnside Steps, the many Crosstown Trail-themed events of \u201cCrosstober,\u201d and the best weather of the year coming up, it seemed a perfect time to celebrate the City\u2019s 900+ stairways. So, we wrote aresolutiondeclaring October to be San Francisco\u2019s first-ever Stairway Month! My colleagues on the Board passed the resolution unanimously on October 1st, so get out there and enjoy District 8\u2019s many stairways! You can find your nearest, or furthest, stairwayhereto plot your adventures. Stairway Month will include aguided walk across five of the City\u2019s tiled staircasesand several other fun events; get involved and find out morehere. Happy trails!Other Legislative HighlightsWe wanted to try something new this month to give you more of a sense of what else we\u2019ve been working on. Here are some of our other legislative highlights from the last month. You can find a complete list onLegistarby using the Advanced Search function with my name.

Although the Board of Supervisors does not have direct authority over the School District, which is governed by an independently elected Board, I have expressed my concerns directly to Superintendent Matt Wayne and members of the School Board and I will continue to advocate for the communities at both schools to ensure an outcome that better meets their needs than the current proposal.We welcome constituent feedback on the school closure proposal; if you have thoughts you would like to share, please feel free to reach out to my legislative aideHenry DeRuff.Thanks for reading, and as always, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with our office.

            "In response to community concerns about traffic safety, the SFMTA is proposing to install all-way stop signs at Church and 28th streets. Improving safety at this intersection has long been a priority for our office and Noe Valley residents. The proposal also includes changes to the location of nearby J Church stops.",
            "If approved, the J Church stops at Clipper and 27th streets would shift to 26th and 28th streets. Shifting these transit stops to even-numbered streets would create more regular spacing that is similar to other stops nearby. For example, the J Church currently has stops at 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th and 30th streets. It would also allow for all-way stop signs to be added at 28th Street without delaying trains. While train stops would shift, no stop signs would be removed.",
            "Some community members have voiced concern over the Muni stop changes, but overall, we\u2019ve heard strong support for the proposal \u2014 especially adding the all-way stop sign. The proposal was presented at an SFMTA public hearing on September 6, and the SFMTA will request final approval from the SFMTA Board on October 15. You can share feedback on the proposal at the board meeting, or by emailing the project team atJChurchProject@SFMTA.com. Check out the proposed J Church changes and sign up for project alerts.",

The new borders between the stations would be Sanchez, 22nd, and Grand View.We have heard from residents and merchants several concerns and priorities, primarily: keeping the Castro beat officers; ensuring institutional knowledge is kept and passed along; and maintaining at least the same level of service.",

        "As we approach the end of summer, I hope you have enjoyed the warm and often cooler weather and spent quality time with your loved ones. With the new school year approaching, I want to remind everyone about the upcoming Legislative Recess. This is an important period for us to reflect, plan, and prepare for the next phase of our community service.The Board of Supervisors will be on Legislative Recess from August 5, 2024, through September 2, 2024, per our regularly scheduled Board meeting calendar.The next regularly scheduled Board meeting will take place on September 3, 2024.During this recess, the Office of the Clerk of the Board will remain open during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., except on legal holidays.

        "If passed, this measure will reimburse San Francisco first responders for outstanding student loans and job-related educational expenses up to $25,000.": [],
        "The fund would be available to 911 dispatchers, police, fire and sheriff's departments, registered nurses, and paramedics. By attracting and retaining talented professionals in San Francisco public safety and healthcare positions, the measure will help address our city's critical staffing, recruitment, and retention challenges.": [],
        "Today, our city faces a severe shortage of first responders. We're about 400 police officers' short which leads to longer response times for 911 calls. Additionally, a shortage of around 175 deputy sheriffs has exacerbated violence and injuries within our jails. It's concerning that we've reached a point where our sheriff is requesting the California Army National Guard to assist our jails.": [],
        "Public safety is a top priority, and we must address these staffing issues. But this measure is about more than that. Because of these staffing shortages, San Francisco is paying out millions in overtime to our overburdened first responders, which makes our city's ongoing deficit even worse. That's just not smart, and it's not sustainable.": [],
        "This measure is fiscally responsible. It supports the well-being and stability of our first responders and will improve public safety across our neighborhoods.": [],

These agreements are instrumental in completing construction projects on time and within budget.San Francisco needs to build 80,000 new homes, and 50% of them must be affordable for working families. My amendments will help the city build these homes by increasing the construction workforce while also supporting small and minority-owned businesses.": [],

It represents a significant win for our city, the community, and the stakeholders that partnered together to ensure the park became a reality.

During this process, abandoned and dilapidated structures were removed, while soft-bottom intertidal and subtidal habitats were restored.",
            "With the southern half of the park now complete, construction crews will next begin improvements at the nearby India Basin Shoreline Park, which was originally constructed in the 1990s. Improvements include major regrading work to ease steep slopes and restoration of the shoreline habitat and native plant landscaping. In addition, the park will receive new amenities including a gravel beach; a cookout terrace and grilling area; a new boathouse, pier, and dock for kayaking and fishing; a renovated children\u2019s play area; two new basketball courts; an adult fitness station; a renovated Bay Trail connecting the area to adjacent waterfront parks; a bicycle path; new lighting and seating; and permanent public art.",

By transforming this once-neglected space into a thriving, accessible public park, we\u2019re not only honoring the history and culture of Bayview but also ensuring that future generations have equitable access to green space, healthy recreation, and economic opportunity right here in our neighborhood.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis park is a milestone not only for San\u00a0Francisco, but for the Bayview Hunters Point community. It marks the realization of a promise made to the community to provide unbridled waterfront access\u2014a community that has often seen commitments go unfulfilled,\u201dsaid Rec and Park General Manager Phil Ginsburg. \u201cWith 900 Innes Ave. now open, the stage has been set for this area to transform into an outdoor oasis along the Bay. Thanks to the community\u2019s voice and our partners, we\u2019re creating a stronger and more resilient Bayview Hunters Point, where residents can thrive.\u201d",

The result is a transformative and long-lasting foundation for economic prosperity that will benefit generations to come.\u201d",
            "A core principle of the project is delivering community benefits at every stage. Contracts were awarded to19 Bayview-Hunters Point contractors and suppliers during the building of the park, including 16 BIPOC-owned businesses, totaling over $15 million in value. Local workforce hiring has also been a priority A workforce development program through partners APRI and the San\u00a0Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development and its CityBuild Construction Training Academy graduated 16 trainees, several of whom secured jobs with Swinerton Construction to help build the park, while others used their newfound skills to secure other family-sustaining jobs. Rec and Park\u2019s pre-apprenticeship program, launching in January, will train residents in landscape maintenance and urban forestry, preparing them for City and private sector jobs.",
            "The EDP leadership also prioritized water safety for neighborhood youth. The Bayview Safety Swim and Splash program, led jointly by Rec and Park and the YMCA of Greater San\u00a0Francisco, has provided free swimming lessons to more than 639 Bayview-Hunters Point kids over the past 3 years. The goal is to ensure that youth are comfortable and confident in the water, meaning that they can swim, float, breathe, and get to safety if needed.",
            "\u201cThis park is a love letter to Bayview residents. It\u2019s a living record of a tremendous effort to anchor in the cultural vibrancy of our beautiful neighborhood,\u201dsaid APRI Executive Director Jackie Bryant. \u201cThis very special place is one in which so many community members contributed to by sharing their hopes and dreams for stronger and healthier future.

            "Today, Bayview-Hunters Point is home to a vibrant and diverse community, consisting of predominantly Black, Asian, and Latino San Franciscans. As early as the 1860s, the India Basin area was a hub to a thriving wooden boat-building industry, cultivating a robust maritime community and serving as an integral part of California\u2019s commercial economy. Around the same time, Chinese fishermen descended onto the area, as its shallow waters facilitated the harvesting of shrimp. Visitors to the new park can learn more about the history of India Basin through displays and exhibitions at the restored Shipwright\u2019s Cottage."

I want to thank our development partners, supporting organizations, and the local community for partnering with the City to make this project a reality.\u201d",
            "Part of the original Mission Bay Master Plan, Bayfront Park sits along the eastern edge of Mission Bay at 16th Street and Terry A. Francois Boulevard on what had been an under-utilized former maritime industrial tract. The park features many native plants, including coastal scrub found along the Bay and bioretention gardens that manage stormwater runoff. The site where the park sits was elevated to provide a robust buffer to from sea level rise and coastal surge.",
            "The project integrates with and improves access to adjacent open spaces: Agua Vista Park and Mariposa Bayfront Park to the south/southwest, and the previously completed portion of Bayfront Park to the north.

Myrna is an urban planner, economic development and housing policy expert, and has served in City government in several different capacities. Myrna is committed to achieving progress that will allow all our City\u2019s people -- including those who have been historically disadvantaged -- to flourish here. Committed to values of progress and equity, Myrna also prizes listening, collaboration, and a pragmatic focus on timely achievement of good results.",
            "Myrna\u2019s family immigrated to San Francisco from El Salvador when she was a child during the 1980s, fleeing that country\u2019s civil war.

Myrna is fluent in English, Spanish and French, and speaks Swedish proficiently. She attended San Francisco State University and graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts from Excelsior College. She holds a Master\u2019s degree in Urban Planning with a concentration in housing development from Columbia University.",

Her legislative priorities include reducing homelessness; increasing the availability of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities for San Franciscans; improving rent control protections for tenants; supporting small businesses, supporting the rights of workers, improving our public transportation infrastructure, reducing our city\u2019s carbon footprint and expanding education opportunities for disadvantaged San Francisco youth and families. Myrna\u2019s priorities also include improving the Westside\u2019s access to senior services, pedestrian, bicycle and transportation improvements throughout District 7 and supporting the safety and resilience of neighborhoods and commercial corridors.",
            "Myrna has also served on the Board of Directors of many San Francisco nonprofit human service organizations. When not working on community issues, Myrna enjoys gardening and cooking.

Today, Connie has served our City at every level and understands how policy goals at the top are implemented into operational actions for San Francisco residents.",
            "Born in Hong Kong, she moved to San Francisco at the age of 13 with her mother and younger brother. Her family was able to obtain a rent-controlled apartment in Chinatown (the same apartment her mother lives in today) because her mother was able to develop the skills she needed for a new career, as a claims processor at Chinese Hospital, thanks to classes at City College of San Francisco.",
            "After graduating from Galileo High School, Connie earned her bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of California, Davis and then went to work giving back to the community that had done so much for her family. She started out as a volunteer interpreter, working with pro bono attorneys for SF Bar Association's Volunteer Legal Outreach, while serving as a community organizer for SF SAFE and Community Youth Center.",
            "In 2006, she was recruited to be an aide to Supervisor Sophie Maxwell and later served as an aide to then-District Attorney Kamala Harris, followed by Supervisor Aaron Peskin in 2016. Since then, Connie also served at San Francisco Recreation & Parks and City College of San Francisco.",
            "Connie\u2019s long-time partner became a San Francisco firefighter in 2011 \u2013 the same year they bought their home in the Richmond District. Today, they are raising their son who is a public school student in the district.",
            "Connie is honored to serve District 1 residents and her priorities as supervisor will be to ensure the same opportunities San Francisco has given her are available for all San Franciscans now and for generations to come."

            "What does the movieInside Outand its cartoon characters of fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy have in common with San Francisco?",
            "It takes all of those emotions to deal with our city\u2019s challenges. Everything that needs fixing can feel daunting. But recognizing joy offers hope.",
            "There is plenty of joy in San Francisco to be found. Think of gatherings with your friends and family. Or how you feel when you experience the natural beauty, cuisine, and culture that defined San Francisco long before \u201cdoom loop\u201d became a buzzword.",
            "The problems in our city are real. So are the joyful things. We must keep that perspective.",
            "I\u2019m focused on getting the basics right: safer streets, better schools, more housing, and vibrant small businesses. These are the foundations for a healthy city.",
            "San Francisco\u2019s best days are ahead if we\u2019re willing to address our problems with equal doses of innovation and common sense. But the energy it takes to fix things is not sustainable without hope. That\u2019s why I believe we must always lead with joy.",
            "When I launched the first-ever Sunset Night Market, more than 10,000 people filled Irving Street.",
            "They were hungry, both literally and figuratively, for good food and a fun experience shared with the community. They were 10,000 doom loop antidotes who reclaimed the narrative of our city.",
            "The night market was more than a party. It made the street a safe place to gather and gave small businesses a boost \u2014 exactly what we need more of in San Francisco.",
            "The path to San Francisco\u2019s future seems to run through neighborhoods like the Sunset. TheNew York Timeshas mentioned it in several recent articles:",
            "\u2022 \u201cThe Outer Sunset has flourished while downtown struggles.\u201d",
            "\u2022 \u201cThousands of people packed Irving Street for the inaugural Sunset Night Market, eating Asian delicacies and watching ballerinas dance in the road.\u201d",
            "\u2022 The Great Highway was named one of \"52 places for a changed world\" when used as a park.",
            "I\u2019m glad journalists are starting to notice how great the Sunset is. Residents have known it all along \u2014 and we still have lots of untapped potential.",

It includes the Sunset, Outer Sunset, Parkside, Pine Lake Park, Lakeshore and Merced Manor neighborhoods."
        ],
        "A Video Love Letter to the Sunset": [
            "This is my love letter to the Sunset in video form. It discovers and celebrates the Sunset experience. I worked with the producers at SFGovTV (City Hall\u2019s cable channel) to pack as much life about the Sunset as possible into the video. It\u2019s a whirlwind of people, places, history, food, and culture."

Commissioner Dang is an inspiring young leader from Balboa High School who in her first term, worked with our office to explore issues ranging from public health strategies in schools to address the opioid crisis, to pushing for Resolution240564that I sponsored,Supporting California State Assembly Bill No. 1975 (Bonta) - Medi-Cal: Medically Supportive Food and Nutrition Interventions. The bill is part of the \u201cFood is Medicine Initiative,\u201d and would make California the first state in the nation to provide covered food prescription interventions. Examples of this would be a physician prescribing \u00a0medically targeted and tailored meals, or prescriptions for produce and other healthy foods, to people with chronic illnesses that are responsive to such measures. We look forward to working with Commissioner Dang in our final few months in office, and know that she will continue in her advocacy with the incoming Supervisor and their team."

            "SAN FRANCISCO (August 15, 2024) \u2014 San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu announced a first-of-its-kind lawsuit today against some of the world\u2019s largest websites that create and distribute nonconsensual AI-generated pornography. The proliferation of nonconsensual deepfake pornographic images has exploited real women and girls across the globe. The lawsuit, filed against the owners of 16 of the most-visited websites that invite users to create nonconsensual nude images of women and girls, alleges the website owners and operators violate state and federal laws prohibiting deepfake pornography, revenge pornography, and child pornography.",
            "\u201cThis investigation has taken us to the darkest corners of the internet, and I am absolutely horrified for the women and girls who have had to endure this exploitation,\u201d saidCity Attorney David Chiu. \u201cGenerative AI has enormous promise, but as with all new technologies, there are unintended consequences and criminals seeking to exploit the new technology. We have to be very clear that this is not innovation\u2014this is sexual abuse. This is a big, multi-faceted problem that we, as a society, need to solve as soon as possible. We all need to do our part to crack down on bad actors using AI to exploit and abuse real people, including children.\u201d"

        "New Ordinance Amendments Regarding General Obligation Bond Passthroughs": [
            "Legislation recently passed that amends the Rent Ordinance to provide that General Obligation Bond Passthroughs from landlords to tenants must be calculated based on the amount the property tax rate has increased due to the repayment of general obligation bonds since the tenant\u2019s move-in date (or Tax Year 2005-06, whichever is later). The legislation also allows tenants to seek relief from payment of the entire Bond Measure Passthrough based on financial hardship. Theamendmentsto the Rent Ordinance take effect on June 10, 2024, and apply to Bond Measure Passthroughs that first go into effect on or after July 1, 2024.",
            "Background",
            "The Rent Ordinance limits rent increases on residential tenants, but allows landlords to \u201cpass through\u201d to their tenants a portion of the change in the property taxes that is the result of the repayment of certain categories of general obligation bonds (\u201cEligible Bonds\u201d). Specifically, landlords can pass through 100% of the change in property tax resulting from bonds issued by the City between 1996-98; 50% of the change resulting from bonds issued by the City after 2002; and 50% of the change resulting from bonds issued by the San\u00a0Francisco Unified School District or the San Francisco Community College District after 2006. The Controller calculates a Citywide passthrough rate each year, based on the amount of the property tax rate in that year that is attributable to Eligible Bonds. The landlord is not required to file a petition with the Rent Board for approval of the Bond Measure Passthrough. However, the landlordmustuse the Rent Board'sBond Measure Passthrough Worksheetin order to calculate the passthrough. To impose the passthrough, a copy of the completed Worksheet must be provided to the tenant in addition to a written notice of rent increase.",
            "What does this legislation change?",
            "The legislation changed how the Controller calculates the tenant passthrough rates. Rather than using a standard passthrough rate for all tenants based on the total cost of the Eligible Bonds under repayment, landlords must now identify a specific passthrough rate for each tenant, which depends on the tenant's move-in date. Each tenant\u2019s passthrough rate is based on a comparison of how much the portion of the property tax rate that pays for general obligation bonds of the three bond issuing entities (the \u201cBond Factor\u201d) has increased between the current year, and the year that tenant moved into the unit (or Tax Year 2005-06, whichever is later). Unless the current year\u2019s Bond Factor is greater than the Bond Factor in the year the tenancy commenced, no Bond Measure Passthrough is available. However, if the Bond Factor had increased since the year the tenancy commenced, the landlord may pass through to that tenant the portion of the increase that was attributable to Eligible Bonds. The Rent Board has updated theBond Measure Passthrough Worksheetsbased on the Bond Factors calculated by the Controller's office to help landlords and tenants calculate the tenant passthrough rates. These changes only apply to Bond Measure Passthroughs that first go into effect on or after July 1, 2024, and do not affect Bond Measure Passthroughs that went into effect prior to that date.",
            "In addition, the legislation allows tenants to seek relief from payment of the entire General Obligation Bond Passthrough by filing aTenant Financial Hardship Application."

        "Mayor London Breed Issues Journey Home Executive Directive To Reunite More People With Family Outside of San\u00a0Francisco": [
            "San\u00a0Francisco, CA\u2014 Mayor London N. Breed today issued theJourney Home Executive Directiveto prioritize relocation support and services for people experiencing homelessness in San\u00a0Francisco. The Directive will require all City Departments and staff to offer relocation assistance and services before providing any other City services, including housing and shelter.",
            "This comes as Mayor Breed has expanded the Journey Home program as well as additional relocation support services that offer return travel expenses in recent years, including the Problem Solving Relocation Assistance and County Adult Assistance Program (CAAP) Relocation Assistance programs.",
            "Journey HomeMayor Breed\u2019s Directive provides clear and comprehensive guidance to all departments with staff that engage with individuals experiencing homelessness, including the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), Human Services Agency (HSA), and Department of Public Health (DPH). The Directive requires the following:",
            "Mandates all City and contracted staff who directly engage with individuals experiencing homelessness to offer access to one of the City\u2019s relocation assistance programs before offering any other City services, including housing and shelter.",
            "Requires first responders, including police officers, firefighters, and paramedics to be provided with handouts that provides information on the City\u2019s relocation services and a contact number.",
            "Establishes a tracking system that will publish data measuring the effectiveness of each program.",
            "Why the Executive Directive MattersThe City\u2019s 2024 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count found that San\u00a0Francisco is experiencing an increase in people who experience homelessness coming to the city from elsewhere compared to previous counts.",
            "Of the individuals surveyed as part of the 2024 PIT Count:",
            "40% responded that they either came to San\u00a0Francisco from another California county or out of state \u2013 up from 28% in 2019.",
            "Similarly, the number of people who had been living in San\u00a0Francisco less than year also increased:",
            "37% of those surveyed who had been previously housed say they had been living in San\u00a0Francisco for less than a year when they became homeless, up from just 15% in 2019.",
            "This was matched by a significant decrease in long-term San Franciscans who had become homeless, showing that San\u00a0Francisco\u2019s efforts to expand housing and homelessness prevention efforts are reducing homelessness:",
            "People who had lived in SF for 10+ years before becoming homeless dropped to 14% surveyed from 43% in 2019.",
            "\u201cSan\u00a0Francisco continues to be committed to investing in effective programs that offer services to help reconnect people living on our streets with their homes as part of our ongoing efforts to address homelessness here in our city,\u201dsaid Mayor Breed. \u201cWhile we will always lead with compassion and we have made significant expansions in housing and shelter, we cannot solve everyone\u2019s individual housing and behavioral health needs. We\u2019ve made significant progress in housing many long-time San Franciscans who became homeless, but we are seeing an increase in people in our data who are coming from elsewhere. Today\u2019s order will ensure that all our city departments are leveraging our relocation programs to address this growing trend.\u201d",
            "Journey Home: San\u00a0Francisco\u2019s Relocation ServicesJourney Home offers travel assistance and temporary shelter for people experiencing homelessness and/or people with substance use disorders. Journey Home brought together all of the city\u2019s relocation services under one umbrella. It is part of San\u00a0Francisco's efforts under the Drug Market Agency Coordination Center (DMACC) for unhoused people and people with substance use disorders.",
            "Since 2005, San\u00a0Francisco has been providing relocation services through its program, previously known as Homeward Bound, which only offered bus tickets for individuals in need. In July 2022, HSH launched its Problem Solving Relocation Assistance program, an initiative that builds on and replaced Homeward Bound. This program offers travel assistance, coordination with support networks, and flexible financial assistance for moving into housing in new communities.",
            "\u201cRelocation and reunification services are a critical component of our Homelessness Response System,\u201dsaid Department of Homelessness said Supportive Housing executive director, Shireen McSpadden. \u201cThis compassionate and effective resource in our system has reconnected thousands of people experiencing homelessness with their stabilizing networks of family and friends.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe San\u00a0Francisco Human Services Agency is committed to connecting our clients who are experiencing homelessness with the services they need,\u201d saidTrent Rhorer, Executive Director, Human Services Agency. \u201cSometimes the most effective service that HSA can provide to our homeless clients is paying for their travel to reconnect them with their families or support networks in the city they used to live.\u201d",
            "Mayor Breed\u2019s Homelessness ResponseSince taking office in 2018, Mayor Breed has significantly expanded and improved San\u00a0Francisco\u2019s homelessness response system, leading to the number of people living on the streets to reach the lowest level in at least 10 years. Under her leadership, San Francisco has expanded shelter beds by over 60%, increased housing slots for formerly homeless individuals by over 50% and added 400 behavioral health treatment beds."

The installation is designed to create a safe and inviting public realm experience in the community for residents, merchants, and visitors.",
            "The project includes the installation of 18 high definition security cameras in Chinatown. It would cover Stockton Street starting from the tunnel at Sacramento Street to Washington Streets.",
            "\u201cThese cameras are part of our work to help Chinatown continue to be an incredible community that is welcoming for both residents and visitors,\u201d said Mayor London Breed. \u201cThis work includes expanding the number of police officers walking beats and creating a drop-in center for people to be able to report crimes. Working together with the community, we can continue to keep Chinatown safe.\u201d",

Central Station has also\u00a0committed an increased police presence on Stockton Street. We know that the best way to ensure\u00a0the public feels safe in their neighborhoods\u00a0is to listen to the feedback from residents and merchants. I'm pleased to see the City finally moving forward with this camera program, as a result.\"",

With this initiative, together we are enhancing safety throughout one of our city\u2019s crown jewel neighborhoods, and ultimately forging a safer San\u00a0Francisco,\u201d Kyra Worthy, Executive Director, SF SAFE.",

            "This project, led by the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, is part of a comprehensive strategy to support diverse small-scale investments aimed at enhancing the visitor and resident experience through economic, safe, and clean programming. Other projects include the installation of ambient light in targeted alleyways in Chinatown during the evenings providing a beautiful spectrum of traditional d\u00e9cor for tourists by day while helping to keep the Chinatown neighborhood feel safe and connected. In partnership with the Portsmouth Square Garage, a discounted parking program is also being offered to residents during the evenings and weekends to not only attract customers to Chinatown but also to prevent car break-ins and theft. And OEWD in partnership with Self-Help for the Elderly funds the services of a bilingual and bicultural corridor personnel that manages the day-to-day field activities in Chinatown. The manager also connects with existing businesses on a regular basis and ensure community services are accessible and solutions meet the needs of the corridor and the small businesses.",

        "Mayor London Breed Announces Roadmap for New Police Reforms": [],
        "Additional reforms will focus on eliminating the need for police to be first responders for non-criminal situations and changing hiring, promotional, training, and disciplinary systems": [
            "San Francisco, CA\u2014 Mayor London N. Breed today announced her vision to fundamentally change the nature of policing in San Francisco and issued a set of policies to address structural inequities. She proposed four priorities to achieve this vision: ending the use of police in response to non-criminal activity; addressing police bias and strengthening accountability; demilitarizing the police; and promoting economic justice. These policies build on the City\u2019s ongoing work to meet the standards contained in President Obama\u2019s 2015 Task Force on 21stCentury Policing.",
            "\u201cSan Francisco has made progress reforming our police department, but we know that we still have significant work to do,\u201d said Mayor Breed. \u201cWe know that a lack of equity in our society overall leads to a lot of the problems that police are being asked to solve. We are going to keep pushing for additional reforms and continue to find ways to reinvest in communities that have historically been underserved and harmed by systemic racism.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe initiatives Mayor Breed is announcing today are consistent with our department\u2019s commitment to the Collaborative Reform Initiative and our aspiration to make the San Francisco Police Department a national model in 21stCentury policing,\u201d said San Francisco Chief of Police Bill Scott. \u201cWe understand that it\u2019s necessary for law enforcement to listen to the African American community and embrace courageous changes to address disparate policing practices, and we recognize it will take sacrifice on our part to fulfill the promise of reform.\u201d",
            "This reform effort will focus on reducing the need for police to be first responders for non-criminal situations, and changing the Police Department\u2019s hiring, promotional, training, and disciplinary systems to better reflect that the department\u2019s fundamental mission to protect and defend all life. It will also focus on demilitarizing the police and redirecting funding to invest in marginalized communities. These reforms will be implemented on an ongoing basis, with some changes going into effect immediately.",
            "These four priorities build on San Francisco\u2019s ongoing police reforms, including efforts to limit use of force and require independent investigations. San Francisco has already implemented several best practices that have been shown to reduce police violence including banning chokeholds and strangleholds, requiring de-escalation, requiring a warning before shooting, and exhausting all other means before shooting. Additionally, San Francisco requires officers to intervene in cases of excessive use of force, bans shooting at moving vehicles, requires officers to use the minimum amount of force necessary when force is used, and requires comprehensive reporting.",
            "Demilitarize Police",
            "Mayor Breed has directed San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) to establish an explicit policy barring the use of military-grade weapons against unarmed civilians. This includes, but is not limited to, chemical weapons such as tear gas, bayonets, and tanks. This plan will call on SFPD to inventory and plan how to divest the Department of any such weapons currently in their possession by the end of 2021, and to create safeguards to disconnect the SFPD from federal grants for weapons of attack used against the community.",
            "End Use of Police as a Response to Non-Criminal Activity",
            "In order to limit unnecessary confrontation between the SFPD and the community, San Francisco will work to divert non-violent calls for service away from SFPD to non-law enforcement agencies. Over the next year, the City will develop a systematic response plan to improve direct connection to community-based or City service providers, such as the CAHOOTS model of crisis response or the Homeless Outreach Team or Street Medicine behavioral health professionals. This plan will also reduce the need for armed police interventions in our schools.",
            "Address Police Bias and Strengthen Accountability",
            "To reduce the persistence of police bias, the Mayor has directed the Department of Human Resources, Department of Police Accountability, and SFPD to identify and screen for indicators of bias, improve training systems, improve data sharing across Departments, and strengthen the SFPD\u2019s Early Intervention System for use of force violations.",
            "Starting immediately, the Department of Human Resources will audit all SFPD and San\u00a0Francisco Sheriff hiring and promotional exams to incorporate state-of-the-art testing for bias and potential for abuse of force. Moving forward, the SFPD and Police Commission will also strengthen the affirmative duty to act policy and tie any violation to transparent disciplinary action.",
            "The Mayor has also directed the Department of Police Accountability to expand their focus beyond individual instances of misconduct, using the Department\u2019s chartered authority to evaluate patterns and practice of bias within the SFPD.",
            "Redirect Funding for Racial Equity",
            "Mayor Breed has announced that divestments from law enforcement will support intentional investment of funds in programs and organizations that serve communities that have been systematically harmed by past City policies.",
            "Decades of disinvestment in the African-American community and racially disparate policies in San Francisco have exacerbated disproportionate harm in Black communities, affecting outcomes from health and wellness to housing insecurity and economic outcomes. On June 4, Mayor Breed and Supervisor Shamann Walton announced a plan to prioritize the redirection of resources from the San Francisco Police Department to support the African-American community in the upcoming budget. They will lead a collaborative process with the community in partnership with the Human Rights Commission to help identify and prioritize funding needs."

As the data comes in we will complete our evaluation and notify applicants as quickly as possible whether their block meets the criteria for acceptance and will proceed to the next step in the process.One final note that applies to all quarterly program cycles, in an effort to minimize\u00a0delay to individual applicants, every effort will be made to collect data in the order in which applications are received, so for a particular quarter, we will start with applications received in Month 1 of that cycle, followed by applications received in Month 2, and so on.Please emailTrafficCalmingApp@sfmta.comif you have questions or need additional information.",
            "The SFMTA\u2019s Traffic Calming Program is a resident-driven, application-based program to address mid-block speeding on residential streets in San Francisco. The program seeks to enhance neighborhood livability by reducing the adverse impacts of vehicular traffic on residential streets and creating safer and more comfortable streets for people walking, bicycling, and driving alike.",
            "Different types of traffic calming are appropriate on different types of streets \u2013 most often it involves physical safety improvements such as speed humps, speed cushions, speed tables, raised crosswalks, median islands, traffic circles, changes to lane widths, and lane shifting. These measures have been proven to reduce speeding and increase safety. Typically, speed humps, speed cushions, and speed tables are the most common traffic calming measures on our streets given their effectiveness in managing vehicular speeds, but other measures can be proposed if they are deemed more effective on a given street.",
            "The City\u2019s Traffic Calming Program focuses on lower-cost measures effective at slowing vehicular speeds on residential streets. The program does not consider larger-scale mitigations to traffic congestion or speeding challenges, speeding on higher-volume arterial streets, nor does it involve multi-block infrastructure improvements. Instead, traffic calming is a resident-directed, block-by-block solution to address mid-block speeding on residential streets.",
            "In addition, traffic calming does not include the use of regulatory measures such as stop signs. Stop signs designate right-of-way for drivers at intersections and can only be installed if certain warrants are met. SFMTA gives careful consideration to the installation of stop signs as they are frequently ignored if not warranted. People crossing on foot can be given a false sense of security if it is assumed that all vehicles will come to a complete stop at a stop sign. Unlike traffic signals or stop signs at intersections, which do not reduce mid-block speeds, traffic calming measures part of this program encourage slower vehicular speed along the length of a block rather than at intersections.",
            "If you have traffic-related issues at a particular intersection, these can be addressed by another group of engineers at the SFMTA. These concerns are best communicated with the SFMTA through the city\u2019s 311 system.",
            "1. Application:Residents who are concerned about speeding on their block are encouraged to submit an application.Applications for the Fiscal Year 2024-2025 Program cycle will be posted online when they are available.Please submit your completed Traffic Calming Request Form in accordance with the instructions provided on the form and below. This is the first step in the process of evaluating traffic calming for each street.",
            "FY 24-25 English Application",
            "FY 24-25 Spanish Application",
            "FY 24-25 Chinese Application",
            "FY 24-25 Filipino Application",
            "Why are applications required?",
            "Applications are required to identify locations where there are speeding concerns. Unfortunately, the demand for traffic calming exceeds the SFMTA\u2019s ability to plan, design, and construct traffic calming projects. Requiring an application ensures there is initial community support for traffic calming before the SFMTA commits its limited resources to begin the process.",
            "How are streets selected?",
            "Streets are selected based on the following:",
            "Eligible residential street:The block must be a local residential street where speed humps and other speed reduction measures would be effective. Generally these are two-lane streets with fewer than 7,500 vehicles per day. Major streets categorized as arterials or collectors are not addressed through residential traffic calming, but rather through other SFMTA programs and projects.",
            "Measurable speeding problem:Streets will only be included where a speeding problem has been demonstrated based on data collection and associated criteria. Generally, this means 85% or more of people driving on the block are doing so at a speed of 5 mph or more above the speed limit, unless other criteria justify the need for traffic calming. These additional criteria include vehicle volumes, collision history, access to transit, presence of a bike route, and certain adjacent land uses that are supportive of walking and bicycling. However, speeding must be measured on the block in order for an application to be successful in being accepted into the traffic calming program.",
            "Prioritized ranking:Eligible applications will be ranked to determine the list of locations most in need of traffic calming in a given application year. The highest ranked locations will receive traffic calming based on funding availability. Funding levels vary from year to year, but typically the SFMTA has funding for approximately 30-40 traffic calming projects per year.",
            "How do I know if my street meets the eligibility criteria?",
            "The SFMTA will measure speeds once applications are submitted. However, before you apply, you can also take a look at the resources below to see if your street may be unlikely to qualify.",
            "Streets with the following characteristics are not likely to be eligible residential streets:",
            "Streets that are classified as \"arterial\" or \"collector\" in the San Francisco General Plan",
            "Streets that are frequently used by fire trucks, or have fire stations on them",
            "Streets with more than two travel lanes",
            "If your street is eligible and has a speeding problem, the following could increase the ranking of your block:",
            "If your block is in a school zone or within close proximity to commercial/retail activity",
            "If there is a community center, senior center, park, or playground on your block",
            "If there is a frequent Muni route within close proximity to your block",
            "If your street is on thebicycle network",
            "What if I want something other than a speed hump?",
            "Speed humps are the most effective measure at reducing speeds and are less resource intensive than less effective tools such as median islands, traffic circles, or lane re-striping. If you apply for traffic calming, your block will first be evaluated for speed humps and only considered for other measures if speed humps are infeasible for some reason.",
            "If you are concerned about safety an intersection, rather than speeds mid-block, traffic calming may not be the appropriate solution. For instance if your primary concerns are about stop signs, yielding, or visibility, these issues are best addressed by another group of engineers at the SFMTA. These concerns can be communicated to the SFMTA throughthe City's 311 online system, or call 311 (for calls outside of San Francisco, dial 415-701-2311).",
            "Why is traffic calming only implemented now on a block-by-block basis?",
            "Previously, the SFMTA used to consider traffic calming from an \u201carea-wide\u201d perspective. The area-wide process was developed as a way to look at multiple locations in the same neighborhood together, to consider traffic calming from a community perspective. The boundaries of area-wide projects were drawn to incorporate all residential streets between arterials, major collectors, and/or commercial streets. However, the process was viewed by SFTMA staff and residents as being time-consuming and resulting in unpredictable construction timelines. Often times, the more complex and expensive measures recommended through an area-wide planning process were not constructed, and the long timeline often resulted in changing community priorities that weren\u2019t reflected in the area-wide traffic calming plan. Finally, due to the fact that the area-wide approach to traffic calming tended to involve only the most dedicated members of a community, many believed that the area-wide process did not necessarily reflect the views and concerns of all neighbors.",
            "A resident-driven, block-by-block approach to traffic calming that relies on a data-driven approach ensures that resources are allocated to those streets in which demonstrated speeding and traffic-related concerns exist, and where there is broad resident acceptance for traffic calming.",
            "TYPICAL VERTICAL DEFLECTION TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICE TYPES",
            "SPEED HUMPS- this is a uniform raised mound across a road. It is generally the most effective traffic calming device, but it is often not supported by the San Francisco Fire Department since humps can slow down emergency response if encountered on too many streets. SFFD is required to approve all traffic calming on streets per the state Fire Code.",
            "Speed Hump | National Association of City Transportation Officialsnacto.org",
            "SPEED CUSHIONS- This is a hump that has wheel slots. The goal of these slots is to minimize impact on vehicles like fire engines and public transit buses.",

        "Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Myrna Melgar Announce Expansion of Free Muni for Youth Program": [],
        "The Free Muni for Youth Program will provide free Muni rides to all youth 18 and under in San Francisco, no application required": [
            "San Francisco, CA\u00a0\u2013 Mayor London N. Breed, Supervisor Myrna Melgar, and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) today announced that the SFMTA will expand the Free Muni for Youth program so that everyone 18 and under can ride Muni free of charge, without having to apply.",
            "The expansion of the Free Muni for Youth Program was originally adopted by the SFMTA Board of Directors in April 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic SFMTA lacked the financial resources to fund this program. By allocating $2 million in the upcoming budget, Mayor Breed is ensuring that Muni is accessible to the more than 100,000 youth across San Francisco.",
            "\u201cFor some people in our city the financial burden of riding Muni is small, but so many young people and families with children rely on public transportation and these fares have a significant impact on their budgets,\u201d said Mayor Breed. \u201cAfter more than a year of social distancing and virtual learning, I want to see students taking the bus to get to school and to hang out with their friends. This will not only save them money, but also hopefully foster a new generation of Muni riders. I want to thank Supervisor Melgar for bringing this idea forward and pushing to make it a reality.\u201d",
            "\u201cCommunities have been fighting for free Muni for all youth for over a decade, and I\u2019m so grateful to Mayor Breed for engaging with me, and for funding a program our city so desperately needs. This collaborative spirit is essential to making progress on community needs,\u201d said Supervisor Melgar. \u201cThis makes sense now during our recovery and it makes sense in the future to reduce our carbon footprint, introduce more riders into the system, and help youth and their families economically by providing free transportation to and from school and activities. This removes barriers, makes for a more confident and equitable system and paves the way for a more accessible system in the future. I look forward to this program\u2019s success, sustainability, and to continuing to advocate for a stronger, sustainable, accessible Muni and to making San Francisco a more child and family friendly city.\u201d",
            "The Free Muni for Youth Program began as a pilot in March 2013, and provides free Muni rides to children ages 5 to 18 who reside in low- to moderate-income households. With this announcement, all young people will qualify for the program without having to apply. The Free Muni for Youth Program will run through Fiscal Year 2021-2022. The SFMTA also provides Free Muni for seniors and persons with disabilities. Program eligibility is set at an annual income at or below 100 percent of the Bay Area median. The SFMTA Board of Directors expanded this program in 2020 to persons experiencing homelessness.",
            "\u201cAs the representative of the District with the largest population of students enrolled in SFUSD, I can tell you with great confidence that having access to Free Muni for all youth will have an overwhelmingly positive impact for working families in my District and throughout the City,\u201d said Supervisor Ahsha Safa\u00ed. \u201cIt is vital to fund Free Muni for all youth as we begin our summer programs and return to in person learning in the fall.\u201d",
            "\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s youth depend on Muni to get them to school, their extracurricular activities, and part-time jobs and more\u2014public transit helps them grow and thrive,\u201d said Gwyneth Borden, Chair of the SFMTA Board of Directors. \u201cOur Board is committed to removing any and all barriers to opportunity and education for the City\u2019s youngest residents.\u201d"

            "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:",
            "Contact: SFDPH Media DeskDPH.Press@sfdph.org",
            "San\u00a0Francisco, CA \u2013 Accidental overdose deaths in San Francisco decreased in 2022, according to preliminary data, marking the second consecutive year that drug mortality rates dropped in the City despite climbing rates across the country, the Department of Public Health (SFDPH) announced Wednesday.",
            "The preliminary data, which is provided by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, indicates that San\u00a0Francisco recorded 620 accidental drug overdose deaths in the 2022 calendar year, compared to 640 deaths reported in 2021 and 725 in 2020. Black individuals continued to be disproportionately impacted by overdoses. Preliminary data shows that overdose death rates among Blacks are more than five times the citywide rate, on par with 2021. The 2022 data shows a 14 percent decrease from the 2020 number when drug overdose rates were at all-time high in San Francisco, in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing presence of the deadly synthetic opioid known as fentanyl.",
            "\u201cFentanyl continues to disrupt and destroy lives in our City and while the overdose numbers have gone down, they still remain far too high,\u201d Mayor London Breed said. \u201cSan\u00a0Francisco remains committed to finding innovative solutions to the ongoing opioid crisis while also focusing on the accountability work with our public safety agencies to get drugs off our streets.\u201d",
            "Fentanyl is the leading driver of drug overdose deaths in the United States, as well as San\u00a0Francisco. Of the 620 deaths in 2022, 72 percent were attributed to fentanyl. A small amount of fentanyl can be fatal and people who use drugs may be unintentionally exposed to it in other drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine.",
            "\u201cFentanyl has had a devastating impact on communities across the country, including San\u00a0Francisco,\u201d said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. \u201cWe are addressing the crisis head on with a multitude of tactics, including growing our substance use treatment services and programs, expanding access to medication, and hiring more outreach staff to engage even more people suffering on our streets and in our neighborhoods.\u201d",
            "There were 107,622 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2021, an increase of nearly 15 percent from the 93,655 estimated in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control National Center for Health Statistics. The 2022 estimates have not been made available, but national trends show few signs of the crisis abating.",
            "Since fentanyl first became prevalent in local drug supplies in 2018, SFDPH has been tackling the crisis from multiple angles. Last year, Mayor Breed and SFDPH created an Office of Overdose Prevention and implemented an Overdose Prevention Plan to coordinate efforts to reduce overdose deaths and mitigate the negative impacts of drug use on individuals and communities.",
            "\u201cThe decline in deaths is encouraging and shows that we can save lives with the programs and policies we are implementing in San\u00a0Francisco,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Hom, who oversees the Office of Overdose Prevention. \u201cThis is not about a single intervention, but a comprehensive public health approach to save more lives and to reduce the profound racial disparities that exist among those dying of overdoses across the City.\u201d",
            "Expanding access to substance use health care and life-saving medications, training City employees and partners on how to recognize and respond to overdoses, and opening more overnight treatment spaces are among the tactics that have demonstratively shown to have made an impact in San\u00a0Francisco.",
            "SFDPH continues to expand access to treatment and care for substance use citywide. This year, SFDPH will open 70 residential step-down beds to offer recovery-settings for people leaving residential substance use disorder treatment and establish weekend hours at the Behavioral Health Access Center to facilitate entry to residential and other substance use disorder treatment.",
            "Across the City, more than 3,200 people received buprenorphine treatment for opioid addiction in 2021, a 12 percent increase from the previous year, and 2,700 individuals received methadone. The Office Based Buprenorphine Induction Clinic, located at 1380 Howard St., treated 575 patients with buprenorphine in 2022, a 164 percent increase from the number of patients in 2021.",
            "In 2021, SFDPH and its community partners distributed more than 33,000 kits of naloxone, the life-saving antidote for opioid overdoses. In 2022, the San\u00a0Francisco AIDS Foundation, which collaborates with SFDPH in its distribution of the medication, distributed more than 40,000 doses of naloxone alone and reported 5,127 reversals. \u00a0Additionally, SFDPH trained more than 2,000 people on how to recognize and respond to an overdose in the last three months of 2022 alone.",
            "SFDPH will also continue to scale up overdose prevention efforts this year by hiring additional overdose prevention staff, increasing its activities in supportive housing facilities in partnership with the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing and the DOPE Project, leading naloxone trainings and distribution in collaboration with the Entertainment Commission, and supporting the expansion of treatment for stimulant use disorder.",
            "In 2024, SFDPH will open a new crisis stabilization unit to provide short-term, urgent care for people experiencing a mental health and/or substance use crisis.",
            "\u201cEvery new or expanded program is another opportunity to make an impact on individuals and families affected by the overdose crisis,\u201d said Dr. Hillary Kunins, Director of Behavioral Health Services at SFDPH. \u201cMaking sure that we reach people most at need and provide the most effective treatment possible will continue to be a priority for as long as drug-related deaths remain pervasive in our communities.\u201d",

            "The good news is that there are easy actions everyone can take to stay healthy this season. Twelve Bay Area health officers recommend the following steps:",
            "Get Vaccinated Against Flu and COVID.",
            "The updated Omicron COVID booster, also known as the bivalent booster, targets the Omicron variant, as well as the original 2020 virus. The Omicron boosters are available for ages six months and older. These improved vaccines are the best protection against severe symptoms of COVID and hospitalization.",
            "Earlier in the pandemic, COVID vaccination rates in the Bay Area were high, shielding some communities from the worst outcomes. This vaccine protection has decreased over time, but an Omicron COVID booster can rebuild it. In most parts of the Bay Area, less than half of eligible people have received the updated Omicron COVID booster.",
            "More people in the Bay Area are getting the flu this year than earlier in the pandemic. Flu is not the same as the common cold and can lead to sudden, severe illness in the\u00a0very young, seniors, and those with underlying medical conditions.",
            "Now is the time to get your flu shot. Your doctor can give you the flu shot and the Omicron COVID booster in the same visit. COVID shots are free and other recommended immunizations are widely available at low or no cost.",
            "There is no vaccine for RSV, but simple measures like regular hand washing and covering coughs can help.",
            "Stay Home if You Are Sick.",
            "No matter which virus you have, if you are feeling sick the best way to keep from spreading it to others is to stay home until you have recovered. If you think it might be COVID, get tested.",
            "People who need urgent or emergency medical care, including testing or treatment for influenza or COVID, should seek it.",
            "Wear a Mask in Indoor Public Places.",
            "Masks can prevent transmission of COVID, flu, RSV, and other respiratory viruses all at once.",
            "Wearing a high-quality mask, such as a KF94, KN95 or N95, can prevent you from getting sick and missing out on life, work, school, and holiday parties. Masking is strongly recommended indoors in public settings to prevent the spread of viruses and reduce the risk of illness.",
            "Masks also lower the likelihood that you pass on an infection if you are already sick, even if your symptoms are mild. This helps protect people around you, especially those at higher risk of serious illness.",
            "Improve ventilation indoors by turning on HVAC systems, filtering the air with a portable HEPA filter, pointing fans out open windows, or opening doors and windows when possible. These can all help viruses from spreading indoors.",
            "Get Tested Before an Indoor Gathering or if You Feel Sick.",
            "Reduce the chances of infecting someone else with COVID by finding out if you have the virus before gathering with others. Remember, COVID symptoms may be mild or absent. Make sure to stock up on home test kits.",
            "Get Treatment, if Needed.",
            "Free treatments are available if you test positive for COVID. Free medication prevents hospitalization and is available to most adults and some teens with even mild symptoms.",
            "Talk to your doctor about treatment options or visitcovid19.ca.gov/treatmentor find a test to treat location near you:aspr.hhs.gov/TestToTreat. Treatments work best when started right after symptoms begin, and within 5 days of symptoms starting.",
            "Health Officers from the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Monterey, Napa, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San\u00a0Francisco, San Mateo, Solano, Sonoma, and the city of Berkeley encourage the public to take these easy steps to protect themselves and others from missing holiday moments and to ease the burden on local health systems. Across the Bay Area, respiratory viruses impact the most vulnerable, including young children, the immunocompromised, people living in crowded housing or congregate living facilities, and seniors, especially at skilled nursing facilities."

        "SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DISTRIBUTE MORE THAN 5,000 HOLIDAY TURKEYS TO COMBAT FOOD INSECURTY": [
            "***PRESS RELEASE***",
            "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The San\u00a0Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) and the San Francisco African American Faith-Based Coalition will give away more than 5,000 turkeys at a holiday food giveaway and health information resources on Saturday.",
            "More than 50 faith-based and community organizations will come to the third annual Feeding 5000 event to collect turkeys, bags of holiday food, gift cards and health resources to distribute among more than 6,700 San\u00a0Francisco households this holiday season.",
            "\u201cAddressing food insecurity and ensuring\u00a0healthy nutrition\u00a0is an important issue for San\u00a0Francisco. SFDPH is working along with many other expert groups and advocates to serve communities most at need,\u201d said Dr. Susan Philip, Health Officer at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. \u201cEveryone has a right to quality foods, not just during the holiday but all year round. Our programs and services are not only meant to feed people for one day\u00a0but secure\u00a0ongoing, continual access to nourishing and culturally appropriate foods. Good health for all requires food security for all.\u201d",
            "Many San Franciscans, particularly Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities, continue to be affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19 and lack the access to healthy foods. Before the onset of the COVD-19 pandemic, one in four San\u00a0Francisco residents were at risk of hunger due to income shortage, and theSan\u00a0Francisco Food Security Task Forceestimates that the number of people struggling has risen since the onset of the pandemic.",
            "\u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity for the city to give back to our most vulnerable communities. This will make a deep impact on the inequality many BIPOC residents feel and is rooted in social determinants of health,\u201d said Veronica Shepard, Director of the Office Anti-Racism and Equity at the San\u00a0Francisco Department of Public Health. \u201cThe incredible partners that have joined this initiative are taking a stance on food insecurity and providing resources that people can easily connect to.\u201d",
            "Food insecurity causes stress, trauma, poor diet quality, and malnutrition and is a major contributing factor to the widening racial health disparities in low-income BIPOC communities. Food insecurity also increases the risk of multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, and exacerbates existing physical and mental health conditions.",
            "\u201cWe are incredibly excited to see massive community support behind Feeding 5000,\u201d said Jonathan Butler, Director of the San\u00a0Francisco African American Faith-Based Coalition. \u201cIt truly does take a village to make an event like this happen. We are grateful for the continued support from the city\u00a0\u2014all of the communities we touch will greatly benefit.\u201d",
            "The San\u00a0Francisco African American Faith-Based Coalition is a health and wellness collaborative of more than 21 churches that is committed to advocating for the needs of the underserved Black people. Collectively, the members of the Coalition represent more than 6,000 San Franciscans.",
            "Feeding 5000 event is a collaborative effort among numerous city departments and community organizations.",
            "This event only distributes food and resources through faith-based and community-based organizations; it does not give donations directly to individuals.",
            "The giveaway is happening Saturday, December 10th from 8:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. at the City College of San\u00a0Francisco parking lot at 11 Frida Kahlo Way."

The ADA and City policy require that people with disabilities have equal access to all City services, activities, and benefits. People with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to participate in the programs and services offered through the City and County of San Francisco.

            "Because the City and County of San Francisco are consolidated, and there is no unincorporated territory in its jurisdiction, the San Francisco LAFCo doesn\u2019t typically oversee annexations or boundary changes, so SF LAFCo's primary function is studying municipal services. Upon SF LAFCo's creation in 2000, the commission initially focused on studies of electricity service--including public power and the creation of San Francisco's community choice aggregation program, CleanPowerSF. Other topics have included refuse services, undergrounding of utility wiring, election services, and the use of City streets for emerging technologies such as app-based deliveries.",

            "Muni is as popular as ever, but an effort to boost its funding to prevent service cuts could fail if a simultaneous move to reform San Francisco\u2019s business taxes proves to be even more popular.",
            "That\u2019s because of a provision buried deep within the text of Proposition M, the business-tax reform measure on the November ballot. That provision essentially declares that it and Proposition L, which would increase taxes on Waymo, Lyft and Uber to fund Muni, are in conflict.",
            "Thanks to that provision \u2014 Section 14 of 16, found on page 109 of the 110-page measure \u2014 Prop. L can win a majority and still lose if Prop. M attracts more votes.",
            "Although Prop. L has widespread backing among city officials and prominent interest groups, the provision requiring it to get more votes than M has caused some anxiety among those involved in the pro-L effort, said Cyrus Hall, the campaign manager.",
            "\u201cWe all feel that this would have been a much easier campaign if we were aiming at 50%,\u201d Hall said.",
            "At first glance, propositions L and M seem to be addressing two completely different problems. The former is intended to help close the yawning deficit the San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency \u2014 Muni\u2019s parent agency \u2014 faces, which its finance chief recently forecastwill reach as much as $322 million in its 2026-27 fiscal year.",
            "Prop. M, meanwhile, represents an attempt to make The City more business-friendly and reduce its revenue dependence on its biggest employers.",
            "The measures bump heads because both would change The City\u2019s gross-receipts tax system. Under that system, companies are taxed in part on how much revenue they generate within The City\u2019s borders.",
            "Prop. L attempts to narrow MTA\u2019s budget deficit by about $25 million annually by placing an additional tax on therevenue robotaxi and ride-hailing companies generatein The City. The tax would range from 1% to 4.5%; the higher the companies\u2019 revenue in San Francisco, the higher the rate they\u2019d pay. At the highest rate, the tax would amount to 45 cents on a $10 ride.",
            "But it comes at the same time that Prop. M would overhaul The City\u2019s entire gross-receipts system, lowering some levies and raising others. Prop. M was specifically intended by those who negotiated it to reduce the complications and add-on taxes \u2014 similar to Prop. L \u2014 that city voters have repeatedly added to that system over the years.",
            "\u201cProp. M is supposed to fix all the problems caused by those [past] ballot measures, and Prop. L is the first step in just doing the same thing again,\u201d said a member of the business community who took part in the negotiations around reforming The City\u2019s business taxes.",
            "It\u2019s not clear at whose direction the provision affecting Prop. L was included in Prop. M. The language was in thedraft of Prop. MthatSan Francisco officials released in May, about a month after Prop. L backers submitted their own proposal to the San Francisco Department of Elections.",
            "The City Attorney\u2019s Office wrote the initial draft of the business-tax reform measure, according to San Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan, who was part of the team of city officials that came up with the parameters of the proposal. But Egan said he didn\u2019t know how the provision affecting Prop L got into that draft.",
            "Alex Barrett-Shorter, a spokeswoman for the City Attorney\u2019s Office, declined to comment on the drafting of the measure. Joe Arellano, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed\u2019s reelection campaign, declined to say whether Breed was involved in putting the conflict language into Prop. M.",
            "Regardless of exactly how the provision got into Prop. M or at whose direction, it wasn\u2019t intended to specifically thwart Prop. L, several Prop M. backers said.",
            "The business-tax reform measure was the result of a more-than-yearlong effort involving intense negotiations among city, business and labor leaders, said Alex Bastian, CEO of the Hotel Council of San Francisco, who helped lead the talks. The end product was a compromise proposition in which none of the stakeholders got everything they wanted, he said.",
            "In order to keep their coalition together, those negotiating the business-tax overhaul reached a basic agreement that any measure they came up with should be essentially revenue-neutral, said Supervisors Rafael Mandelman, who helped start the reform effort and played a key role in the talks. But neither labor groups nor business leaders were thrilled about that idea, he said. Business groups wanted to push for a big tax cut, while labor wanted to raise taxes to cut The City\u2019s deficit, Mandelman said.",
            "Supervisor Rafael Mandelman during the Board of Supervisors meeting at City Hall in San Francisco on Tuesday, May 7, 2024.",
            "The concern among those who hashed out the compromise that became Prop. M was that one or both of those groups would put a competing measure on the ballot, according to Bastian, Mandelman and Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who also played a central role in the negotiations.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was on anyone\u2019s mind that someone might be working on what turned out to be Prop. L,\u201d Mandelman said. The concern about another measure, he continued, \u201cwasn\u2019t about L. It was about an alternative business-tax reform.\u201d"

            "The conflict provisions such as the one in Prop. M are commonly found in ballot measures, especially if there\u2019s concern about a competing measure, Peskin said. Propositions D and E, which will also be on the November ballot and offer competing ways to streamline the number of city commissions, each contain similar provisions.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common language,\u201d Peskin said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it in many different things.\u201d",
            "But at least one person in City Hall familiar with the development of business-tax reform said people involved in that effort were aware of Prop. L, at least after it had been submitted, and were worried that it would undo the work they had just gone through.",
            "The concern is that Prop. L is based on the existing gross-receipts system, not the one Prop. M would establish. If Prop. L were also to go into effect, the robotaxi and ride-hailing companies would have to calculate their business taxes using both the new formula created by Prop. M and in part using the old formula that Prop. M is trying to dispense with, the City Hall insider said.",
            "The advocates who developed Prop. L. \u201cdid not take into account the work that we were doing in Prop. M,\u201d the insider said.",
            "But the sponsors of Prop. L said they went through a similar \u2014 if not as fraught \u2014 process of developing their measure. The group of transit advocates had been working on it for more than a year, determined tofind a way to support Muniwhen it looked like none of the local politicians were going to step forward and do so, they\u2019ve said.",
            "Using an additional gross-receipts tax to fund Muni was not Prop. L backers\u2019 first choice, Hall said. Instead, they wanted to pursue a bigger funding measure that would fully close the agency\u2019s deficit, he said. But after numerous discussions with supervisors, the Mayor\u2019s Office, community organizations and others, it became clear to them that such a large-scale measure wasn\u2019t politically feasible this year, so they dropped the idea, Hall said.",
            "They also explored increasing the existing tax on ride-hailing fares that wasimposed by Prop. Din 2019, he said. But that kind of tax is capped by state law, he said, so the transit activists hit on an additional gross-receipts tax.",
            "\u201cWhen we started looking at smaller options, the one that we felt we could create political momentum behind was a gross-receipt tax on ride-hail activity,\u201d Hall said.",
            "A Waymo autonomous vehicle on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco on Monday, June 10, 2024.",
            "The activists behind Prop. L were aware of the effort to reform The City\u2019s business taxes, said Kat Siegel, one of the measure\u2019s authors. But they didn\u2019t know the proposition that came out of that effort was going to be on the ballot this year, she said.",
            "As far as she knows, Siegal said, transit activists weren\u2019t involved in the business-tax reform effort. And no one from that effort reached out to the developers of Prop. L, she and Hall said.",
            "Regardless, because they knew there was a possibility that a business-tax reform measure might be on the same ballot as their transit measure, Siegal and her collaborators tried to design their proposition so it wouldn\u2019t conflict with what became Prop. M, she said. Prop. L would create a completely new section of the business-tax code, so it doesn\u2019t overwrite any of the existing sections, she said.",
            "Although Prop. L has a provision addressing a potential conflict with a competing measure, its text wouldn\u2019t invalidate Prop. M. And Prop. L would calculate its tax using just the ride-hailing companies\u2019 San Francisco revenue; it wouldn\u2019t take into account their payroll in The City. One of the key motivations of the business-tax reform isreducing the importance of payroll in calculating levies.",
            "\u201cWe wanted to make sure we were heading in the same direction\u201d as the business-tax reform effort \u201cand that we were compatible with whatever The City ended up negotiating out with its partners in the business community,\u201d Hall said.",
            "Hall said he reached out to the Prop. M backers once the measure was submitted to the Department of Elections and the conflict between the two became clear. But he said he got little response.",
            "Although Prop. L\u2019s backers aren\u2019t happy about having to garner more support than Prop. M, Hall said they feel like they have momentum at their back. In a recent survey of Muni riders, 72%rated the transit service as good or excellent\u2014 the highest level of support recorded since the agency began polling riders in 2001.",
            "Prop. L\u2019s backersgot 7,000 more signatures than they neededto get the measure on the ballot. They\u2019ve alsosecured the support of 10 of the 11 city supervisors, Mayor Breed, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, state Sen. Scott Wiener and numerous community groups.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not sitting around fretting about having to get more votes than M,\u201d Hall said. \u201dBecause the only thing that we can do is just run the absolute best campaign possible and get the highest number of votes we can get.\u201d",

The red-brick station building is a former library directly across from McCoppin Square. Look for the sculpture of children sticking out over a window on its side.
