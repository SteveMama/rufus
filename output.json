            "Since the launch of our partnership, Medium members have told us that audio has helped them consume more stories than ever before \u2013 up to three times as many. Audio helps people listen to Medium articles during the day when they normally wouldn\u2019t be reading: while going on walks, commuting, exercising, doing chores, doing other things on their computer, or even as they fall asleep.",
            "We\u2019ve also heard many members tell us they retain information better when they have a chance to listen and read at the same time. This is a new way of consuming content that our partnership supports \u2013 Speechify highlights text as it reads the audio out loud to you.",
            "\u201cWhen working out, I used to read on my phone between sets. Now, it\u2019s so much easier with audio \u2014 I can listen to many more articles than I could read before.\u201d \u2014 Jess, Medium listener",
            "From everything we\u2019ve heard, we believe the Speechify play button on Medium can make your experience with Medium more enjoyable and flexible."

        "A Magical Way to Read More": [
            "If you love reading, you probably have a long list of articles bookmarked. You can now use the Listen feature to make your way through that list faster. Speechify also allows you to change your listening speed. Some users listen to articles at 2-3x the normal listening speed. You can listen to articles at up to 4.5x the normal speed. Speed listening is a productivity hack for many, and we\u2019re excited to make it easier for you."

        "A Tool for Proofreading": [
            "We\u2019ve heard that writers find the Listen feature helpful when they\u2019re proofreading their drafts. Sentences often sound different when you read them out loud, and we\u2019re excited to help our community of creators improve the stories they bring to life. To listen to one of your drafts, you can click the \u201c\u2026\u201d button in Medium\u2019s web editor, then select \u201cshare draft link,\u201d visit that link yourself, and click the Listen button."

        "Making Reading Easy": [
            "By some estimates, one in five people faces dyslexia, which can make traditional reading difficult. Many people also have visual impairment. Through our listening option, we aim to lower the barrier to learning and delight across Medium."
        ],
        "How You Can Listen to Medium with Speechify": [
            "You can find the Listen button at the top of a Medium story. When you press this button via web browser, as a logged-in Medium member, the story text is read to you and you\u2019ll see the words highlighted as you go.",
            "We all have our own tastes. If you\u2019d like to listen to a voice other than the default option, you can select a new one by clicking the voice button in the bottom left corner.",
            "In the bottom right corner, you can click the speed button to adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 4.5x.",

For purposes of this section a \u201cconsumer\u201d means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d).

The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn\u2019t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.",

Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."
