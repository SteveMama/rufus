https://speechify.com/medium,Medium members can listen to any Medium story with the Speechify Play Button.,"At Medium and Speechify, we’re always exploring new ways to make content more accessible. That’s why we’re excited to share that Speechify is available to all Medium members with the launch of Medium’s Listen feature. Any Medium member can click the “Listen” button at the top of most stories to hear an audio versionread aloudfrom a number of narrators. Users who aren’t Medium members will be invited to sign up for membership. Since the launch of our partnership, Medium members have told us that audio has helped them consume more stories than ever before – up to three times as many. Audio helps people listen to Medium articles during the day when they normally wouldn’t be reading: while going on walks, commuting, exercising, doing chores, doing other things on their computer, or even as they fall asleep. We’ve also heard many members tell us they retain information better when they have a chance to listen and read at the same time. This is a new way of consuming content that our partnership supports – Speechify highlights text as it reads the audio out loud to you. “When working out, I used to read on my phone between sets. Now, it’s so much easier with audio — I can listen to many more articles than I could read before.” — Jess, Medium listener From everything we’ve heard, we believe the Speechify play button on Medium can make your experience with Medium more enjoyable and flexible."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Magical Way to Read More,"If you love reading, you probably have a long list of articles bookmarked. You can now use the Listen feature to make your way through that list faster. Speechify also allows you to change your listening speed. Some users listen to articles at 2-3x the normal listening speed. You can listen to articles at up to 4.5x the normal speed. Speed listening is a productivity hack for many, and we’re excited to make it easier for you."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Tool for Proofreading,"We’ve heard that writers find the Listen feature helpful when they’re proofreading their drafts. Sentences often sound different when you read them out loud, and we’re excited to help our community of creators improve the stories they bring to life. To listen to one of your drafts, you can click the “…” button in Medium’s web editor, then select “share draft link,” visit that link yourself, and click the Listen button."
https://speechify.com/medium,Making Reading Easy,"By some estimates, one in five people faces dyslexia, which can make traditional reading difficult. Many people also have visual impairment. Through our listening option, we aim to lower the barrier to learning and delight across Medium."
https://speechify.com/medium,How You Can Listen to Medium with Speechify,"You can find the Listen button at the top of a Medium story. When you press this button via web browser, as a logged-in Medium member, the story text is read to you and you’ll see the words highlighted as you go. We all have our own tastes. If you’d like to listen to a voice other than the default option, you can select a new one by clicking the voice button in the bottom left corner. In the bottom right corner, you can click the speed button to adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 4.5x. Happy listening! – Team Medium & Team Speechify"

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration,"We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, 548 Market St., PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104–5401. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."

Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California.

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration,"We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, 548 Market St., PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104–5401. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."

In countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement. In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Medium and Medium Parties won’t be liable for: (a)Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, even if Medium or the other Medium Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. (b)Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability of Medium and the other Medium Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of $50.00 USD or the amount paid by you to use our Services."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------new_post_topnav-----------,Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration,"We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, 548 Market St., PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104–5401. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------new_post_topnav-----------,Governing Law and Venue,"These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles. Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California. Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------new_post_topnav-----------,Amendments,"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you don’t agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services."

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------new_post_topnav-----------,Miscellaneous,"Medium’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.

http://yourfriends.medium.com,Boost Nomination Pilot Help Center,"Thank you for participating in Medium’sBoost Nomination Pilot program! As a reminder, this program is still in beta, and changes frequently as we test different processes and systems. The best way to keep up with these changes is to carefully read the weekly newsletters sent to participants. All changes are also documented in theprogram FAQ. If you’re not a member of the program, you can join the waitlisthere."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,Submit a request,Here are some of the most frequent questions from nominators:
http://yourfriends.medium.com,Can I get additional feedback about why a nomination was declined?,"Disagreeing (sometimes strongly!) with a declined nomination is a natural, expected
                aspect of participating in this program. Understandably, many nominators would
                like to appeal a nomination decision they disagree with, receive detailed feedback
                about a declined nomination, or gather more information about how stories could
                be improved to be selected for Boost. However, this program’s nomination and
                review process is focused on decision-making only. There are no appeals, nor
                are we able to offer individual guidance on why a story was not Boosted. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,How many stories can I nominate a month?,"When you start the program, you can nominate five posts per calendar week, up
                to 20 a month. Aim to nominate five posts by the 7th of the month, another five
                by the 14th, and so on. The goal of this weekly guideline is to spread Boost
                nominations throughout the month, to avoid “dead zones” with few nominations
                coming in, and backlogs at the end of the month with last-minute nominations.
                All your nominations for the month must be received by midnight UTC on the final
                day of the month. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,"As a publication editor, can I nominate a story before it’s published?","Yes, and we recommend doing so! This is the most efficient way to nominate a
                story from your publication: Edit the story draftSchedule the draftto publish a couple days in the futureNominate the story bysharing the draft linkin the Boost nomination formYou'll hear back within a day or so if the story is selected for BoostIf it's selected for Boost, the story will automatically get Boosted immediately

https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,1. Medium Privacy Policy,"This policy explains what information we collect when you use Medium’s sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”). It also has information about how we store, use, transfer, and delete that information. Our aim is not just to comply with privacy law. It’s to earn your trust."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Information We Collect & How We Use It,"Medium doesn’t make money from ads. So we don’t collect data in order to advertise to you. The tracking we do at Medium is to make our product work as well as possible. This includes basic product functions like allowing our metered paywall to work and key features like personalizing what posts you see based on what we think you’ll like. So, to give you the best possible experience in using Medium, we collect information from your interactions with our Services. Some of this information, you actively tell us (such as your email address, which we use to track your account or communicate with you). Other information, we collect based on actions you take while using Medium, such as what pages you view (including how much of a given page and for how long) and your use of product features (like Save to Medium, highlights, follows, and applause). This information includes records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address, information about your device (such as device or browser type), and referral information (how you got to a particular page). We use this information to: provide, test, improve, promote and personalize the Servicesfight spam and other forms of abusegenerate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use the Services When you create your Medium account, and authenticate with a third-party service (like Twitter, Facebook, Apple or Google) we may collect, store, and periodically update information associated with that third-party account, such as your lists of friends or followers. We will never publish something through one of your third-party accounts without your express permission."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Information Disclosure,"Medium won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you to a third-party. We may transfer your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonymization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone. If we are going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We will object to legal requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Public Data,"Search engines may index your Medium user profile page, public interactions (such as claps or highlights), and post pages, such that people may find these pages when searching against your name on services like Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing. Users may also share links to your content on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Data Storage,"Medium uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Medium. Wemaintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using the Services, you authorize Medium to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Third-Party Embeds,"Some of the content that you see displayed on Medium is not hosted by Medium. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in a Medium page, so that it appears to be part of that page. For example: YouTube or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs, SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code snippets, or Scribd documents that appear within a Medium post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, that video appears because of a pointer to files hosted by YouTube, and in turn YouTube receives data about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch). Medium doesn’t control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they ultimately do with it. So, third-party embeds on Medium are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service (so, when you watch a YouTube video embedded in a Medium post, the use of data about your interactions with the video would be covered by YouTube’s privacy policy). Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as submitting your email address, through a form linked to from a Medium post. We do our best to keep bad actors off of Medium. However, if you choose to submit your information to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on Medium asking for your email address or any other personal information. Make sure you understand who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do not submit your email address or other personal information to any third-party through an embedded form. When posting on Medium, you may not embed a form that allows submission of personal information by users. You must link offsite to a page that allows such submissions by users, and that page’s appearance must be distinct enough from Medium to ensure it does not cause confusion among users over to whom they are submitting personal information. Failure to do so may lead Medium to disable the post or take other action to limit or disable your account."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Tracking & Cookies,"We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language), evaluate email effectiveness, allow our paywall and meter to function, and personalize content and other services. Without cookies, our metered paywall would not work, so they are necessary to Medium’s basic functionality. Medium saves data about the URLs you Save to Medium (an optional feature that you may choose to use or decline to use), but we do not otherwise track your visits or activities off Medium Services. We track your interactions within the Medium Services (which encompasses Medium.com, custom domains hosted by Medium, and your interactions with our mobile application). Some third-party services that we use to provide the Service, such asGoogle Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Medium only and not the use of cookies by third parties."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information,"If you have a Medium account, you can access, modify or export your personal information, or delete your accounthere. To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief time period (generally several weeks). But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time. Medium may preserve and maintain copies of your information beyond this time period when required to do so by law."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Data Security,"We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Business Transfers,"If we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Email from Medium,"Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account). But, you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account’sSettingspage. When you interact with an email sent from Medium (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction. We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, please forward it to us at legal@medium.com so we can investigate."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Changes to this Policy,Medium may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always behereand we will archive former versions of the policyhere.

https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Description of Processing Activity,Medium collects and stores personal information about its users to customize their reading experience and enable personalized distribution of content. It shares minimal data with its service providers.
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Purposes of Processing,"Provide, test, promote, and improve the ServicesGather usage statistics of servicesProvide customized reading experiencePublish and distribute user-generated contentProvide access to paid contentPay authors in Partnership Program for certain contentFight spam, fraud, and other abuse of services"
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Legal Bases,"In order to provide the Services, Medium collects and stores personal data about its users to fulfill its contractual obligations to users as described in our Terms of Service and to Members as described in ourMembership Terms of Service. Medium also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the Services, as outlined above, as well as to ensure that new users trying out the free member preview do not exceed their maximum limit of free articles per month before a paid subscription is required to read further. These legitimate interests are not outweighed by (nor do they violate) our users’ privacy interests because we collect minimal user data for these purposes and we are fully transparent about these activities. Where Medium collects and stores personal data about non-users mentioned in user-generated content, it does so under performance of contract obligations to users who use the Services to publish content on web sites hosted by Medium. In such cases, users authoring such user-generated content containing personal data of third parties are responsible for that content. Medium will consider related complaints in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation’s rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and access to information."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Public Nature of Personal Data,"Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the Services in the form of clapping for a post, highlighting parts of a post, following other user accounts, sharing links on connected social media accounts, or writing original posts. Where such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user. Additional information on potential consequences of such processing can be found below. If you do not agree to this public usage, do not create an account or use these features of the Services. Search engines may index your Medium user profile page, public interactions (such as claps or highlights), and post pages. Users may also share links to your content on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter."

https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Categories of Recipients,"Medium shares minimal personal data with third-party processors in order to provide the Services. These processors offer at least the same level of data protection as that set out in this statement. This includes the following categories of recipients: Hosting, Storage, & Other InfrastructureSecurityAnalyticsCommunication & SupportPayment Processors"
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Payment Processors,"Medium provides Services in conjunction with several payment processors, including: Stripe, PayPal, Google Play, and Apple Pay, through which users may pay for Medium memberships or receive payment based on participation in our Partner program. Those companies acting as payment processors may collect and store personal data related to your billing information and history in order to provide their services, and may collect and store personal data and business data to prevent fraud and other abuse. When you delete your Medium account, Medium deletes your personal data as explained in this policy. However, to delete your payment or billing information, you will need to do so with your payment provider, as Medium only has minimal secure access to those records as needed to provide the Services."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Use of Algorithms to Personalize User Experience,"Medium collects and stores personal data about its users to customize their reading experience by displaying content tailored to the preferences and interests indicated by the users (including through their reading history and Services interactions). This does not constitute automated decision-making as that phrase is used in the GDPR because it does not produce any legal effects or similarly significant effects for users. Medium also moderates content for the purposes of fighting and preventing spam, fraud, and other forms of abuse, and may rely on algorithms as part of doing so."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Potential Consequences of Processing,"By creating and using an account on Medium, users may make certain personal data about themselves public and accessible to others on their profile and through network interactions. This may in some cases constitute special category protected data which is considered manifestly made public by the user. Due to the public nature of information posted to Medium, it may be possible for third parties to derive identifying personal data from posts, whether by reading, inference, supplemental research, or automated extraction and analysis. Users are free to use their real name and information, or a pseudonym of their choosing, for their account. Users may also choose to use the service without posting data or engaging in network interactions. However, if you do not agree with and accept the risks of such usage, you may not use the Services."
https://medium.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052305234,Cross-border Transfers,"Medium is hosted in the United States. By using the Services, you authorize Medium to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. Where your data is disclosed to our processors, it is subject by contract to at least the same level of data protection as that set out in this statement."

It is our primary graphic device and should be the first choice when choosing a graphic element to represent the Medium brand. The Medium logo.Minimum digital size: 25 pixels (height)

https://medium.design/f1a01a733592?source=author_recirc-----f03bf92035c9----3---------------------92f91979_b46c_49d9_a37f_bddb2ce384ed-------,Logo clearspace and margins,"When using the logo in a design or placing it next to other visual elements, you should ensure that it has plenty of room to breathe. This is where clearspace and margins come in to play. The logo’sclearspacedefines the distance between the logo and any graphic element it may be sitting next to in a composition. Use the cap height from the wordmark as a reference for the appropriate clearspace. Cap height = X For example:if you were to place the Medium logo,sized 30px tall, in a logo pool next to other logos, you should ensure that the Medium logo has at least30px of clearspaceon all sides. Logo clearspace— cap height = X The logo’smarginsare the space between the logo and the edge of the composition. When placing the logo in a composition use half the cap height (X/2) as the distance to the margin. This is a suggested margin, do not place the logo any tighter — but in certain instances the space can be increased. For example:if you were to place the logo,sized 30px tall, in the top left corner of a composition, the distance between the top and left sides of the logo and the top and left edges of the composition should beno less than 15px. Logo margins— X/2, X=Cap height"

This may be suitable to do when the symbol color matches the illustration color, and the wordmark color matches the headline or typography. This is not the primary expression of the logo— it is an option when a composition may need more dynamism. It should be used sparingly and with care."

https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/,29 Wavelength Zones,for ultralow-latency applications
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/,Why Cloud Infrastructure matters,"The AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure is a secure, extensive, and reliable cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Whether you need to deploy your application workloads across the globe in a single step or you want to build and deploy specific applications closer to your end users with single-digit millisecond latency, AWS provides you the cloud infrastructure where and when you need it.With millions of active customers and tens of thousands of partners globally, AWS has the largest and most dynamic ecosystem. Customers across virtually every industry and of every size, including start-ups, enterprises, and public sector organizations, are running every imaginable use case on AWS."
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/,AWS a Leader in 2023 Magic Quadrant for SCPS,"Customers are increasingly choosing AWS to host their cloud-based infrastructure and realize increased performance, security, reliability, and scale wherever they go.Amazon Web Services (AWS) was named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services (SCPS) report and placed highest in Ability to Execute axis of measurement among the top 8 vendors. Read the full Gartner report here »"
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/,Benefits,"SecuritySecurity at AWS starts with our core infrastructure. Custom-built for the cloud and designed to meet the most stringent security requirements in the world, our infrastructure is monitored 24/7 to help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. All data flowing across the AWS global network that interconnects our datacenters and Regions is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. You can build on the most secure global infrastructure, knowing you always control your data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention at any time.AvailabilityAWS delivers the highest network availability of any cloud provider. Each region is fully isolated and comprised of multiple AZs, which are fully isolated partitions of our infrastructure. To better isolate any issues and achieve high availability, you can partition applications across multiple AZs in the same region. In addition, AWS control planes and the AWS management console are distributed across regions, and include regional API endpoints, which are designed to operate securely for at least 24 hours if isolated from the global control plane functions without requiring customers to access the region or its API endpoints via external networks during any isolation.PerformanceThe AWS Global Infrastructure is built for performance. AWS Regions offer low latency, low packet loss, and high overall network quality. This is achieved with a fully redundant 400 GbE fiber network backbone, often providing many terabits of capacity between Regions. AWS Local Zones and AWS Wavelength, with our telco providers, provide performance for applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies by delivering AWS infrastructure and services closer to end-users and 5G connected devices. Whatever your application needs, you can quickly spin up resources as you need them, deploying hundreds or even thousands of servers in minutes.ScalabilityThe AWS Global Infrastructure enables companies to be extremely flexible and take advantage of the conceptually infinite scalability of the cloud. Customers used to over provision to ensure they had enough capacity to handle their business operations at the peak level of activity. Now, they can provision the amount of resources that they actually need, knowing they can instantly scale up or down along with the needs of their business, which also reduces cost and improves the customer’s ability to meet their user’s demands. Companies can quickly spin up resources as they need them, deploying hundreds or even thousands of servers in minutes.FlexibilityThe AWS Global Infrastructure gives you the flexibility of choosing how and where you want to run your workloads, and when you do you are using the same network, control plane, API’s, and AWS services. If you would like to run your applications globally you can choose from any of the AWS Regions and AZs. If you need to run your applications with single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices and end-users you can chooseAWS Local ZonesorAWS Wavelength. Or if you would like to run your applications on-premises you can chooseAWS Outposts. If you are in a public sector organization or highly regulated industry, you can read our plans to launch theAWS European Sovereign Cloud.Global FootprintAWS has the largest global infrastructure footprint of any provider, and this footprint is constantly increasing at a significant rate. When deploying your applications and workloads to the cloud, you have the flexibility in selecting a technology infrastructure that is closest to your primary target of users. You can run your workloads on the cloud that delivers the best support for the broadest set of applications, even those with the highest throughput and lowest latency requirements. And If your data lives off this planet, you can useAWS Ground Station, which provides satellite antennas in close proximity to AWS infrastructure Regions."
