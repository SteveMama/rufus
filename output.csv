When you interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third party’s site directly. For example, when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch. Medium does not control what information third parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed."

You can actually find content you can build your brain with. I appreciate that, both as a reader and a writer. Cassie Kozyrkov,Chief Decision Scientist at Google and Medium member Medium has proved a game-changer for me, and quickly became the subscription I value the most, and I have quite a few. The cost is nothing compared to the value Medium generates for me month after month. Enrique Dans,Professor of Innovation at IE Business School and Medium member For us tech folks, Medium membership unlocks a whole treasure trove of high-quality articles. One good technology book could sell for over the Medium membership fee amount. It’s your choice whether to buy one book, or buy hundreds and thousands of books by unlocking member-only reading on Medium. Investing in a Medium membership is one of the best investments I have ever made for my career. Wenqi Glantz,Software Architect at ArisGlobal and Medium member"

Medium needs this license because you own your content and Medium therefore can’t display it across its various surfaces (i.e., mobile, web) without your permission. This type of license also is needed to distribute your content across our Services. For example, you post a story on Medium. It is reproduced as versions on both our website and app, and distributed to multiple places within Medium, such as the homepage or reading lists. A modification might be that we show a snippet of your work (and not the full post) in a preview, with attribution to you. A derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes on Medium that uses portions of your content, again with full attribution. This license applies to our Services only, and does not grant us any permissions outside of our Services.

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Transfer and Processing Data,"In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the US and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Indemnification,"To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Medium, and our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the“Medium Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights) or your violation of the law. You agree to promptly notify Medium Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Medium Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees).

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Disclaimers — Service is “As Is”,"Medium aims to give you great Services but there are some things we can’t guarantee.

We do not control or endorse, and we make no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content. You access and use Third-Party Content at your own risk. Some locations don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Limitation of Liability,"We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so; this includes any liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Medium or the other Medium Parties in providing the Services. In countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement. In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Medium and Medium Parties won’t be liable for: (a)Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, even if Medium or the other Medium Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. (b)Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability of Medium and the other Medium Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of $50.00 USD or the amount paid by you to use our Services."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration,"We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, 548 Market St., PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104–5401. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Governing Law and Venue,"These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles. Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California. Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Amendments,"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you don’t agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Severability,"If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Miscellaneous,"Medium’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically."

https://speechify.com/medium,Medium members can listen to any Medium story with the Speechify Play Button.,"At Medium and Speechify, we’re always exploring new ways to make content more accessible. That’s why we’re excited to share that Speechify is available to all Medium members with the launch of Medium’s Listen feature. Any Medium member can click the “Listen” button at the top of most stories to hear an audio versionread aloudfrom a number of narrators. Users who aren’t Medium members will be invited to sign up for membership. Since the launch of our partnership, Medium members have told us that audio has helped them consume more stories than ever before – up to three times as many. Audio helps people listen to Medium articles during the day when they normally wouldn’t be reading: while going on walks, commuting, exercising, doing chores, doing other things on their computer, or even as they fall asleep. We’ve also heard many members tell us they retain information better when they have a chance to listen and read at the same time. This is a new way of consuming content that our partnership supports – Speechify highlights text as it reads the audio out loud to you. “When working out, I used to read on my phone between sets. Now, it’s so much easier with audio — I can listen to many more articles than I could read before.” — Jess, Medium listener From everything we’ve heard, we believe the Speechify play button on Medium can make your experience with Medium more enjoyable and flexible."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Magical Way to Read More,"If you love reading, you probably have a long list of articles bookmarked. You can now use the Listen feature to make your way through that list faster. Speechify also allows you to change your listening speed. Some users listen to articles at 2-3x the normal listening speed. You can listen to articles at up to 4.5x the normal speed. Speed listening is a productivity hack for many, and we’re excited to make it easier for you."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Tool for Proofreading,"We’ve heard that writers find the Listen feature helpful when they’re proofreading their drafts. Sentences often sound different when you read them out loud, and we’re excited to help our community of creators improve the stories they bring to life. To listen to one of your drafts, you can click the “…” button in Medium’s web editor, then select “share draft link,” visit that link yourself, and click the Listen button."
https://speechify.com/medium,Making Reading Easy,"By some estimates, one in five people faces dyslexia, which can make traditional reading difficult. Many people also have visual impairment. Through our listening option, we aim to lower the barrier to learning and delight across Medium."
https://speechify.com/medium,How You Can Listen to Medium with Speechify,"You can find the Listen button at the top of a Medium story. When you press this button via web browser, as a logged-in Medium member, the story text is read to you and you’ll see the words highlighted as you go. We all have our own tastes. If you’d like to listen to a voice other than the default option, you can select a new one by clicking the voice button in the bottom left corner. In the bottom right corner, you can click the speed button to adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 4.5x. Happy listening! – Team Medium & Team Speechify"

It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for whatever you have to say. We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging. Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. They’re software developers, amateur novelists, product designers, CEOs, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know too. Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of over a millionMedium memberswho believe in our mission. If you’re new here,start reading.
