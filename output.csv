https://medium.com/membership,What members are saying,"The easy path in social media is promoting the worst content, the cheapest, tackiest, lowest-effort stuff. That’s not what you get on Medium. You can actually find content you can build your brain with. I appreciate that, both as a reader and a writer. Cassie Kozyrkov,Chief Decision Scientist at Google and Medium member Medium has proved a game-changer for me, and quickly became the subscription I value the most, and I have quite a few. The cost is nothing compared to the value Medium generates for me month after month. Enrique Dans,Professor of Innovation at IE Business School and Medium member For us tech folks, Medium membership unlocks a whole treasure trove of high-quality articles. One good technology book could sell for over the Medium membership fee amount. It’s your choice whether to buy one book, or buy hundreds and thousands of books by unlocking member-only reading on Medium. Investing in a Medium membership is one of the best investments I have ever made for my career. Wenqi Glantz,Software Architect at ArisGlobal and Medium member"

https://medium.com/about?autoplay=1,Everyone has a story to tell,"Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share knowledge and wisdom with the world—without having to build a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for whatever you have to say. We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging. Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. They’re software developers, amateur novelists, product designers, CEOs, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know too. Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of over a millionMedium memberswho believe in our mission. If you’re new here,start reading. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something familiar—and thenwrite your story. About Terms Privacy Help Teams Press"

https://speechify.com/medium,Medium members can listen to any Medium story with the Speechify Play Button.,"At Medium and Speechify, we’re always exploring new ways to make content more accessible. That’s why we’re excited to share that Speechify is available to all Medium members with the launch of Medium’s Listen feature. Any Medium member can click the “Listen” button at the top of most stories to hear an audio versionread aloudfrom a number of narrators. Users who aren’t Medium members will be invited to sign up for membership. Since the launch of our partnership, Medium members have told us that audio has helped them consume more stories than ever before – up to three times as many. Audio helps people listen to Medium articles during the day when they normally wouldn’t be reading: while going on walks, commuting, exercising, doing chores, doing other things on their computer, or even as they fall asleep. We’ve also heard many members tell us they retain information better when they have a chance to listen and read at the same time. This is a new way of consuming content that our partnership supports – Speechify highlights text as it reads the audio out loud to you. “When working out, I used to read on my phone between sets. Now, it’s so much easier with audio — I can listen to many more articles than I could read before.” — Jess, Medium listener From everything we’ve heard, we believe the Speechify play button on Medium can make your experience with Medium more enjoyable and flexible."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Magical Way to Read More,"If you love reading, you probably have a long list of articles bookmarked. You can now use the Listen feature to make your way through that list faster. Speechify also allows you to change your listening speed. Some users listen to articles at 2-3x the normal listening speed. You can listen to articles at up to 4.5x the normal speed. Speed listening is a productivity hack for many, and we’re excited to make it easier for you."
https://speechify.com/medium,A Tool for Proofreading,"We’ve heard that writers find the Listen feature helpful when they’re proofreading their drafts. Sentences often sound different when you read them out loud, and we’re excited to help our community of creators improve the stories they bring to life. To listen to one of your drafts, you can click the “…” button in Medium’s web editor, then select “share draft link,” visit that link yourself, and click the Listen button."
https://speechify.com/medium,Making Reading Easy,"By some estimates, one in five people faces dyslexia, which can make traditional reading difficult. Many people also have visual impairment. Through our listening option, we aim to lower the barrier to learning and delight across Medium."
https://speechify.com/medium,How You Can Listen to Medium with Speechify,"You can find the Listen button at the top of a Medium story. When you press this button via web browser, as a logged-in Medium member, the story text is read to you and you’ll see the words highlighted as you go. We all have our own tastes. If you’d like to listen to a voice other than the default option, you can select a new one by clicking the voice button in the bottom left corner. In the bottom right corner, you can click the speed button to adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 4.5x. Happy listening! – Team Medium & Team Speechify"

If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.

No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Governing Law and Venue,"These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles. Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California. Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Amendments,"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms.

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f,Miscellaneous,"Medium’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9455427953559&form=true&source=login--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Can I get additional feedback about why a nomination was declined?,"Disagreeing (sometimes strongly!) with a declined nomination is a natural, expected
                aspect of participating in this program. Understandably, many nominators would
                like to appeal a nomination decision they disagree with, receive detailed feedback
                about a declined nomination, or gather more information about how stories could
                be improved to be selected for Boost. However, this program’s nomination and
                review process is focused on decision-making only. There are no appeals, nor
                are we able to offer individual guidance on why a story was not Boosted. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."
https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9455427953559&form=true&source=login--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,How many stories can I nominate a month?,"When you start the program, you can nominate five posts per calendar week, up
                to 20 a month. Aim to nominate five posts by the 7th of the month, another five
                by the 14th, and so on. The goal of this weekly guideline is to spread Boost
                nominations throughout the month, to avoid “dead zones” with few nominations
                coming in, and backlogs at the end of the month with last-minute nominations.
                All your nominations for the month must be received by midnight UTC on the final
                day of the month. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."

                story from your publication: Edit the story draft Schedule the draftto publish a couple days in the future Nominate the story bysharing the draft linkin the Boost nomination form You'll hear back within a day or so if the story is selected for Boost If it's selected for Boost, the story will automatically get Boosted immediately

http://yourfriends.medium.com,Boost Nomination Pilot Help Center,"Thank you for participating in Medium’sBoost Nomination Pilot program! As a reminder, this program is still in beta, and changes frequently as we test different processes and systems. The best way to keep up with these changes is to carefully read the weekly newsletters sent to participants. All changes are also documented in theprogram FAQ. If you’re not a member of the program, you can join the waitlisthere."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,Submit a request,Here are some of the most frequent questions from nominators:
http://yourfriends.medium.com,Can I get additional feedback about why a nomination was declined?,"Disagreeing (sometimes strongly!) with a declined nomination is a natural, expected
                aspect of participating in this program. Understandably, many nominators would
                like to appeal a nomination decision they disagree with, receive detailed feedback
                about a declined nomination, or gather more information about how stories could
                be improved to be selected for Boost. However, this program’s nomination and
                review process is focused on decision-making only. There are no appeals, nor
                are we able to offer individual guidance on why a story was not Boosted. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,How many stories can I nominate a month?,"When you start the program, you can nominate five posts per calendar week, up
                to 20 a month. Aim to nominate five posts by the 7th of the month, another five
                by the 14th, and so on. The goal of this weekly guideline is to spread Boost
                nominations throughout the month, to avoid “dead zones” with few nominations
                coming in, and backlogs at the end of the month with last-minute nominations.
                All your nominations for the month must be received by midnight UTC on the final
                day of the month. For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."
http://yourfriends.medium.com,"As a publication editor, can I nominate a story before it’s published?","Yes, and we recommend doing so! This is the most efficient way to nominate a
                story from your publication: Edit the story draft Schedule the draftto publish a couple days in the future Nominate the story bysharing the draft linkin the Boost nomination form You'll hear back within a day or so if the story is selected for Boost If it's selected for Boost, the story will automatically get Boosted immediately
                  upon its scheduled publication For more information, please seethis sectionof the program FAQ."

Country expansion is the most requested change to the Partner Program, and we’re thrilled to support writers from as many countries as possible to write and be rewarded on Medium. We’ve also made a few other updates and improvements to the program. Here are the headline changes: We support 77 new countries, bringing us to a total of 119 countries. There will be a $10 USD minimum payout threshold. We’re expanding the Boost Nomination Program to allow editors from these newly supported countries to join. We’ve updated the Partner Program Dashboard to share more details about your earnings."
https://blog.medium.com/weve-added-77-countries-to-the-medium-partner-program-827a574fcdf0?source=collection_home---5------1-----------------------,Why we’re excited to include more writers in the Medium Partner Program,"The Medium Partner Program allows writers to earn money for their stories. Our mission is to deepen our readers’ understanding of the world. The more writers we can support and reward, the richer and deeper our community will be, and the better we’ll be able to serve our readers. We can’t wait to showcase and pay more writers to share their thought-provoking perspectives and international voices with our readers. To everyone who has emailed us, messaged us on social media, or shared feedback on the Partner Program over the last couple of years: thank you. When speaking with many of you, one of the top questions I’d get would be about when we were planning to expand country support for the Partner Program. It’s great to give a positive answer to those questions. I’ve worked on the Partner Program for almost three years now, and I’ve personally reviewed over 10,000 Partner Program applications from writers all over the world (back when we processed each and every application manually!). I’ve read and responded to hundreds of emails sharing feedback and requests related to the Partner Program, including wanting the application and enrollment system automated and quicker (done!), updating the Partner Program Dashboard (done!), and incentivizing more high quality stories on Medium (done and still working to make it better!). These new updates have involved the whole company, with multiple engineers, designers, and product and content team members working to open up and grow the Partner Program as much as possible. We mean it when we say we’re listening to what you and everyone else in the Medium community have to say. Let’s go into more detail about the changes!"

If your stories do not earn $10 in a given month, the balance will be rolled over to the following month until you meet the minimum threshold. For example, if you earn $6 in January and $5 in February, we will send your total earnings for those months to you in early March. To learn more about the $10 minimum payout,check out this article."
https://blog.medium.com/weve-added-77-countries-to-the-medium-partner-program-827a574fcdf0?source=collection_home---5------1-----------------------,We’re expanding the Boost Nomination Program to include nominators from more countries.,"Since we can now pay writers from those 77 additional countries through the Medium Partner Program, we can also recruit and pay Boost nominators based in those countries. In fact, we’ve already started the process. For anyone not in the know, our Boost Nomination Program is one of the ways we handpick some of the best stories on Medium to get extra visibility. While we have a team of internal curators, we also rely on independent editors within the Medium community to find and nominate stories for a Boost. When nominated stories are selected for a Boost, the nominator earns a flat fee. You can readmore about the Boost here. We asked a few of our newest nominators from newly supported countries to share a bit about why they’re excited to join both the Medium Partner Program and the Boost Nomination Program. Here’s what they had to say: “I am so excited about the MPP opening up for India! After waiting almost 30 months, signing up took me exactly 30 seconds. While I am happy about being rewarded for my writing, I am honored to be on the International Boost Nominating team as an editor. I love helping writers fine-tune their work. Being a boost nominator will enable me to showcase writers from my region and beyond. I am thrilled that Medium will help them get the recognition they deserve.”—Vidya Sury, Collecting Smiles,nominator fromNamaste Now I’m here for a good read. As a Medium member since 2019, I’ve seen how this platform differentiates conventional publishing, allowing creators to focus on their work of art without having to fret about the exhausting process of publishing. As an editor, I’m amazed at the pool of talent abundantly afloat here. I constantly scout for good poetry, prose, and technical articles out there. Only, now I’m being rewarded for that! I’m thrilled that Sri Lanka is finally in the MPP and excited for all my fellow writers for the rewarding scheme this presents. —Viraji Ogodapola, nominator fromThe Howling Owl I just joined the Medium Partner Program, and I’m so excited it finally opened in India. I had to pinch myself twice to make sure it was true. Ever since I joined Medium in 2018, I’ve been waiting for this day. So grateful to Tony and team for making this possible. Long live Medium! —Sai Krishna Kothapalli, nominator fromInfoSec Write-Ups With emerging writers entering the English-speaking digital writing space, South Korean writers have many stories to tell.

Medium needs this license because you own your content and Medium therefore can’t display it across its various surfaces (i.e., mobile, web) without your permission. This type of license also is needed to distribute your content across our Services. For example, you post a story on Medium. It is reproduced as versions on both our website and app, and distributed to multiple places within Medium, such as the homepage or reading lists. A modification might be that we show a snippet of your work (and not the full post) in a preview, with attribution to you. A derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes on Medium that uses portions of your content, again with full attribution. This license applies to our Services only, and does not grant us any permissions outside of our Services.

We may use this feedback for any purpose, in our sole discretion, without any obligation to you. We may treat feedback as nonconfidential. We may stop providing the Services or any of its features within our sole discretion. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage and may remove or limit content distribution on the Services."

https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Transfer and Processing Data,"In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the US and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Indemnification,"To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Medium, and our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the“Medium Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights) or your violation of the law. You agree to promptly notify Medium Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Medium Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Medium Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Medium’s sole option, of any third-party Claims."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Disclaimers — Service is “As Is”,"Medium aims to give you great Services but there are some things we can’t guarantee. Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. You understand that our Services and any content posted or shared by users on the Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

No advice or information obtained from Medium or through the Services will create any warranty or representation not expressly made in this paragraph. Medium may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through our Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We do not control or endorse, and we make no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content. You access and use Third-Party Content at your own risk. Some locations don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Limitation of Liability,"We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so; this includes any liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Medium or the other Medium Parties in providing the Services. In countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement. In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Medium and Medium Parties won’t be liable for: (a)Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, even if Medium or the other Medium Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. (b)Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability of Medium and the other Medium Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of $50.00 USD or the amount paid by you to use our Services."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration,"We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, 548 Market St., PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104–5401. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. (a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. (b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. (c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1,et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. (f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim. (g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.” (h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Governing Law and Venue,"These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles. Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California. Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Amendments,"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you don’t agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Severability,"If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions."
https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=register--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------,Miscellaneous,"Medium’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically."

https://blog.medium.com/how-our-quality-guidelines-incentivize-your-best-writing-and-how-we-curate-those-stories-for-our-c1c7310e3950?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------,Update to our quality guidelines (August 2024),"Terrie Schweitzer Follow The Medium Blog 6.8K 83 Listen Share Why should you publish your story on Medium? There are many good reasons — our simple, intuitive editor, our strong domain authority, and how easy and quick it is to publish a story, for example. But one of the main reasons is that if your story is good, it has a shot at reaching a wide audience. Unlike other platforms, you don’t need an external audience. You don’t need to know anything about SEO. Those things can certainly help, but our curation and distribution system is designed to match great stories with interested readers, so you can focus on telling your unique stories without needing those skills. Our recommendations system is built around incentivizing writers to share the deepest, richest stories. This is in contrast to, for example, a common and infuriating format of recipe posts you find on the open web: you’re forced to scroll through page after page of nonsense to get to the actual recipe. That extra “story” is all for the sake of creating advertising space and optimizing the page to rank higher in search engines. It’s not done for the reader. This isn’t because the writer doesn’t care about the reader; it’s because theincentives are not alignedbetween reader, writer, and publisher. Since we’re supported by readers, not by advertising, we have the privilege of keeping our curation focused on the reader."
https://blog.medium.com/how-our-quality-guidelines-incentivize-your-best-writing-and-how-we-curate-those-stories-for-our-c1c7310e3950?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------,"Our readers value thoughtful, nuanced, knowledgeable perspectives — we do, too","We’re pleased to announce a new revision to ourQuality Guidelinestoday. This revision changes little in the guidelines themselves; most of the updates are clarifications based on feedback we received from writers and editors. If you’re new to our Quality Guidelines, welcome! These are the same guidelines used by our curation team, and describe how we assign each story we review to one of three distribution categories: Network Distribution — stories that are matched to readers who are following that specific writer (and/or thepublication, if the article is in a publication). This is the baseline category for any story on Medium which does not violateMedium rules. General Distribution — stories that earn General Distribution are matched to readers based on their interests, and on related writers or publications they follow. These stories are also given Network Distribution. Boost — especially high-quality stories that meet our Boost Guidelines (below). These get a higher priority in being matched to readers and are also given General and Network Distribution. Writers and editors who are interested in how stories are chosen for Boost can find more details inthose guidelines. There you’ll find that the criteria for Boosting stories is based on five broadly defined factors: Writer’s experience Value and impact Respect for the reader Non-derivative Writing and craftsmanship I’d like to share some of our thinking behind “writer’s experience,” which is a unique element in our stance on quality in writing, and something we’ve found that our readers especially value."
https://blog.medium.com/how-our-quality-guidelines-incentivize-your-best-writing-and-how-we-curate-those-stories-for-our-c1c7310e3950?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------,Our readers love your experience,"Readers prize reading stories that have a clear sense of a writer’s experience not because it makes a story warm, inviting, or emotional — though it can certainly do all of those things. They prize your experience becauseit transfers valuable understanding to them. For example, anyone can look up how to prepare roasted potatoes and write a story about it. It could even be a good story. But it’s not what our readers come to Medium for. We call this a “write-around” — pick a topic, look some things up, and write around it. Write-arounds can convey information but they typically miss the mark on conveying real understanding. Over time, we’ve emphasized writer’s experience in our Quality Guidelines, and we’ve noticed that writers are mistakenly trying to check that box, rather than give the spirit of what our readers really want. For example, some writers will include a personal anecdote somewhat related to the topic of the story, followed by a write-around. We also see stories that sprinkle in anecdotes, opinions, “in my experience” phrasing, and other bits that seem to be an attempt to fill this criteria for Boosting. However, the writer doesn’t bring any actual insight into the subject at hand. This type of “filler” is disappointing to the reader who wants the writer to share the actual experience they could learn and grow from."
https://blog.medium.com/how-our-quality-guidelines-incentivize-your-best-writing-and-how-we-curate-those-stories-for-our-c1c7310e3950?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------,An example of writer experience versus a write-around,"The state of recipes — real instructions for cooking food — offers great examples of what we mean by a story that provides writer experience in the form of insight rather than filler. Compare, for example,Crispy Oven Roasted PotatoestoThe Best Crispy Roast Potatoes Ever Recipefrom Serious Eats. What Are the Best Potatoes for Roasted Potatoes? The answer to this question is: it’s your choice. I prefer a smaller potato like the baby red or white potatoes so there are fewer cuts of the knife to make. But if you prefer, use yukon golds, sweet potatoes, or even russet potatoes, and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Versus: For variety, I tried the three most common supermarket types: russet, Yukon Gold, and red. Russets get the crispest crusts and roast up a pale golden brown. Their interiors are fluffy and mild. Yukon Golds roast a little darker owing to their lower starch content and higher sugar content. This leads to more flavor, but it also means a slightly less crisp crust. Their interiors are nice and creamy, with plenty of flavor. Red potatoes roast up very dark because of their very low starch content, but have difficulty getting crisp. They come out of the oven crunchy, but soon lose that crunch, turning soft and tender. Both are well-written and valuable to readers. Both contain personal experience. However, in the first case, the experience offered doesn’t contribute anything to elevate the readers’ understanding of how to make delicious roasted potatoes. In the second case, the reader’s experience goes far deeper: experimenting with different varieties, testing different techniques, and making specific recommendations based on that experience. The first example is good writing, but it’s not nearly as helpful. “It’s your choice” is just filler. Insight into the actual differences — from someone with direct experience of cooking them — is far more valuable. The recipe byKenjiis infused throughout with this sort of direct experience that the other example lacks — even though that other example sprinkles in lots of colorful asides."
https://blog.medium.com/how-our-quality-guidelines-incentivize-your-best-writing-and-how-we-curate-those-stories-for-our-c1c7310e3950?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------,Boost is a high bar,"When you get a story Boosted, you should be proud because it means we think it represents the best of the best on Medium. It’s a story we are thrilled to share with readers, and we trust that they’ll be equally thrilled to read. The process of curation is a process of finding the best exemplars of our Boost Guidelines, because these types of stories provide the best experience to readers. Unlike a lot of other places on the internet, there aren’t any easy formulas to reach a wide audience on Medium. There’s no specific title, length, time of publishing, or topic that does best. All our incentives are set up instead to reward writers for sharing their best stories with our readers. To reach an audience on Medium, a good place to start is to focus on your own lived experience, and consider why sharing that experience can be valuable to another person. Why areyouwriting about this particular topic? What can you uniquely bring to the story, and why is that valuable to another person? Meeting that requirement of writer’s experience alone doesn’t guarantee that a story will be Boosted. But it’s a good place to start for any writer striving to authentically connect with their reader. And when your story does get Boosted on Medium, you can be sure that it’s a meaningful act. It wasn’t done in the service of advertising, or SEO, or to generate filler material as a vehicle for any of that. It was done as recognition of your excellence in deepening our understanding of the world through the power of writing. Thank you for being a part of this community."

I’ve worked at Medium for over a year now, but I’ve been on the platform since 2012 — and I’ve really loved watching what this company and community have become over that intervening decade plus. I enjoy Medium because I always feel good after I spend some time perusing my home feed. We’ve heard from a few users that they enjoy Medium because it feels like it’s good for their brains — or that they at least feel better after they spend time here. We love it, and gotta say that feedback like the below are the sorts of things that keeps all of us working happily away. In recent internal discussions, we’ve talked about how while the story is the core of our platform, the community is the connective tissue, which makes sense, considering the drive for an audience is what defines the difference between a blog post and a diary entry. And it’s true — part of the joy of writing here is knowing that your work will be read by readers and community members outside of your existing network, and that readers are here to deepen their understanding of the world. And that’s pretty cool, if you ask me! AsTony Stubblebinewrote a couple of months ago, we are trying to build a better internet, one digital brick at a time. And though it’s not always perfect, and there’s an endless amount of work that still needs to be done, we come to our (entirely remote) work every morning hoping we can deepen understanding by building communities around our shared stories. That’s a lot to aspire to, but it sure makes the job fun. Now, let’s take a look at what happened around the ol’ Medium ranch last month, shall we? -Amy Widdowson, VP of Communications"

https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,How to run a publication that fits with the Boost Nomination Program,
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,Why we’re so excited about niche topic publications,"Ariel Meadow Stallings Follow The Medium Blog 7.3K 88 Listen Share If you attendedPub Crawl, you heard that yourpublications are a priority at Medium in 2024. We want to sharethoughtful, nuanced, knowledgeable perspectives, and theBoost NominationProgram is how independent publication editors nominate high-quality stories for broader distribution across Medium. But what makes a publication a good fit for this program? We think it comes down to four common attributes: A focused publication topic High quality writing Publication editors with a strong POV or expertise on a subject Clear publication submission guidelines If you edit a publication that you’d like to be considered for the Boost Nomination Program (or you’re thinking of starting a publication that might fit within the program), here’s additional insight into the kinds of publications we’re looking for right now."
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,Focused publication topic,"One of the primary goals of the Boost Nomination Program is to have a broad range of topics represented. As the program has grown, we’ve recognized that the publications that thrive (with high nomination acceptance rates and higher story views) are the ones focused on a topical niche, with a very specific audience in mind. This means we’re looking forpublications that share stories speaking to readers with very specific interests and goals. Here are a few examples of focused publications currently nominating stories: Runner’s Life Code Like A Girl The Unexpected Autistic Life Cantor’s Paradise Crow’s Feet: Life As We Age Long COVID Connection This focus on topically-focused publications doesn’t mean we won’t add more general interest publications to the program in the future. Right now, however, we’re focused on working with editors running publications that speak to very specific audiences Takeaway:Ensure your publication has a clear topical focus, ideally one that’s differentiated from other publications in the program. You can see current pubs in the programhere."
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,Quality of the publication’s stories,"When we look at a publication that’s expressed interest in joining the Boost Nomination Program, we check if the stories in the publication fit withMedium’s Quality Guidelines. Do the stories in the publication look Boostable? Have any of their stories or writers already been Boosted? We’re looking for editors that understand what quality means on Medium, and who are taking a strong stance towards reflecting that in their publication. Takeaway:Demonstrate that you’re invested in your publication’s stories by keeping the quality bar high."
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,Editor expertise,"We are hoping to work with more publications run by (and featuring the writing of) experts, operators, professionals, academics, and first-persondo-ers. In the same way thatMedium’s Quality Guidelinesemphasize that author experience is one of the five pillars of a story being eligible for Boost, a publication editor’s experience with the topic of their publication is an important factor. Here are examples of nominating editors with a connection to their publication topics: Live View: The editor is a working photographer with a popular podcast and has been leading workshops and facilitating online communities for years. Pink Hair & Pronouns: The editor is the parent of a gender nonconforming child EduCreate: The editor is professor and creator with a PhD in writing and rhetoric Takeaway:Your Medium bio should reflect your connection and experience with your publication’s topic."
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,Clear submission process,"We want to partner with editors who are actively working with writers in their pubs, and part of how we measure that is by looking at a publication’s submission page. (Note: if a publication only has one author or isn’t actively accepting submissions, they’re not a fit for the Boost Nomination Program.) We want to see a publication’s submission page clearly linked from the publication’s homepage, and we check the submission page to make sure the publication has clear processes that emphasize quality over quantity. Examples of clear submission pages: Submission guidelines for A-Culturated Guide to writing for Code Like a Girl Guide to writing for EduCreate Takeaway:Your publication should have a submission page clearly linked from its homepage, with clear submission processes for writers."
https://blog.medium.com/bnp-editors-9c0a6f5a133a?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------,"Let’s create a thriving ecosystem of diverse, high-quality publications!","As a reminder,any Medium membercan start a publication, and thenanypublication can apply for the Boost Nomination Program. While following the guidance here won’t guarantee that your publication will be approved for the program, it goes a long way in our consideration. If you’re an editor who’d like to get involved with nominating, you can applyhere. We’ve made some big changes in how we’re processing applicants and should be able to respond to new applicants within a few weeks. It’s worth noting some of the things that wedon’tlook at when considering publications for the Boost Nomination Program: we don’t care about the number of followers a publication or its editor have, how old the publication is, or the visibility of the publication’s writers. We’re focused on things like publication topics, editor experience, and story quality — not popularity. The Boost Nomination Program is about finding the hidden gems and new writers on Medium, and we love how publication editors help us do that. If you’ve got questions, feel free to leave a response!"

https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,How to add pronouns to your Medium profile,
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,A simple how-to guide,"Sieran Lane Follow The Medium Blog 6.4K 102 Listen Share Editor’s note: As welaunch pronounson Medium profiles, we wanted someone in our community to share their experience with the feature. We askedSieran Laneif he’d be up for writing this story explaining how — and why — to set up your pronouns on Medium. Enjoy! I’m a queer, non-binary trans person who goes by he/him pronouns. But in the past, I went by ze, zim, zis, zizelf. People often ignore the pronouns I write in my bio, and just call me whatever gender they believe I am. Many say they/them, which is a decent and well-meaning attempt. But I actually feel more comfortable with he/him. Hence, I was excited to see Medium add the pronoun feature! It will appear on our profile, beside our name when we comment, and when we hover the mouse over our name. In this piece, I’m going to show you how to set up your pronouns on your Medium profile."
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,How to add pronouns,Note: This is for the desktop version of Medium. The app version may be a little different.
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,Step 1: Find the settings,"Go to the top right-hand corner of the Medium home page. Click your profile picture. In the dropdown menu, press Settings."
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,Step 2: Go to your profile,"In the Settings window, click Profile information. You’ll see “Edit your photo, name, pronouns, short bio, etc.” here as well."
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,Step 3: Pick your pronouns,"In the new window that appears, you’ll see a rectangular field under Pronouns. Start typing in your pronouns. You can include a maximum of four. If you don’t see your pronouns, you can also click “Suggest others” to request them. As an example, I’ll type in “he.” You can see a dropdown menu of all available pronouns that contain “he.” This includes he, her, she, them, and they. When I enter “i”, this shows him, it, and zim. For my own profile, I decided on he, him, ze, and zim."
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,Why it matters,"While many people use a name that’s easily read as their correct pronouns, many others use a more gender neutral name. My name, Sieran, is androgynous. So some people even ask me whether I’m male or female…The answer is neither. I’m nonbinary. But I like to use he/him pronouns. Some folks use non-Anglo Saxon names that people outside of their culture don’t know how to decode, gender wise. And some people use names that are traditionally read as a certain gender, but they actually have a different gender. For instance, I have a friend named Erin. But he is non-binary, not female. And he goes by he/ him and they/them. Checking someone’s photo to guess gender isn’t the best solution, either. Not everyone uses a photo of their face. And some of us, like myself, have a photo that people often interpret as the wrong gender. It’s quite unpleasant when someone calls you by the wrong pronouns, even if it’s unintentional."
https://blog.medium.com/how-to-add-pronouns-to-your-medium-profile-c1856e7ecb74?source=collection_home---5------4-----------------------,"What are these ze, zim, etc. pronouns?","These are neo pronouns, i.e. pronouns that are not the standard he, she, or they. For more information about pronouns, neo pronouns, and how to use them, check outLibby Winkler’s guide,Understanding Pronouns: A Guide for Allies. The English language is constantly evolving. Some of us don’t feel that he, she, or they truly express how we feel inside. So we may use other ones. Contrary to popular belief, not all non-binary people go by they/them pronouns, though most do. Personally, ze/zim was the closest to how I felt, though I use he, him, ze, and zim. Some people cannot understand how I could use the masculine he/him pronouns yet be non-binary. I mostly switched to he/him, because few people understood how to use ze/zim. A lot of people just avoided using pronouns for me at all. And it was awkward to hear them say my name so many times in a sentence. Some ally friends said I should stand up for my pronouns, because people ought to respect them. They mean well, but it’s hard for me too to see people struggle with my pronouns or simply avoid them. So I gave up and used he/him. But pronouns are very personal. It’s not some 1 to 1 rule, where you must use certain pronouns if you have a certain gender identity. Thus, this is an important new feature on Medium. I feel heartened that I can display my pronouns prominently on Medium now, so there is no more ambiguity for people."

We want to deepen readers’ understanding of the world and empower writers to share their best work and biggest ideas. A few days ago, we took a huge step in making that a little more real: weopened up our Partner Program to 77 additional countries. This means that writers from 119 countries will now be able to earn for sharing their deepest, most meaningful stories with our readers. I don’t have the full answer for what it means to deepen understanding, but I know that can only happen when our platform is open to as many people, from as many varied backgrounds, telling as many different kinds of stories, as possible. Technically, this didn’t happen on Medium in July, but it’s been in the works for the past year and I’m thrilled to share this news with our readers, writers, and editors today. I can’t wait to see what new stories we’ll get the chance to read and share! –Zulie @ Medium"

We earn and maintain freedom through the unity of shared values, common decency, and the strength to resist forces that would disrupt and destroy us.” —Bebe Nicholson, writer and editor, in her piece, “I Am Grieving For My Country, and Maybe You Are Too” “My field has not lost relevance or interest. It’s just that no one wants to pay for it.” —Brian S. Hook, Classics professor, in his piece, “How I Lost My Job As a Tenured Professor”"

The best part is that writers don’t need a pre-existing audience to be Boosted.

https://blog.medium.com/it-happened-on-medium-july-2024-roundup-d66951d5bfdb?source=collection_home---5------0-----------------------,Big topics: The Olympics and a new Democratic nominee,"July was an eventful month, and experts and first-person observers alike came to Medium to share their thoughts on world-changing events. When President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic nominee for this year’s election, former PresidentBarack Obamafirstshared his thoughts on his former VP’s decision, and laterhis endorsement of VP Kamala Harrisas the new Democratic nominee. Lawyer and political writerJohn Polonis (""Johnny P"")explainshow Harris could become the official Democratic Presidential nomineedespite not winning a single primary. Author and speakerJulia Seranowrites from a queer perspectiveabout why that “weird” messaging seems so effective against the Republicans. “[Republicans] are heavily invested in the notion that their perspective and lifestyle is the one true and righteous way that all others must follow. Calling them ‘weird’ upends this worldview,” she writes. For more stories about the election, check out theElection 2024 tag page. On to lighter news: the 2024 Paris Olympics. Did you know that until 1952, the Olympics included fine arts events? Head of Marketing at the Minneapolis Art InstituteRobert Bedeauxexplainswhat happened to art events, and how the tradition lives on in today’s Olympics. On the opposite end of the spectrum, physics faculty member and science bloggerRhett Allaincalculates the optimal shot put launch angle, whichhe determines to be exactly 37.1 degrees. Read more about the Olympics, past and present, in theOlympics tag page. Many other notable things happened in July 2024 that we haven’t got space for in this newsletter, so I’ll bring these roundups to your attention instead: CrowdStrike: a root cause analysis. Why did this happen? Why did the update fail? How did that mismatch happen? And perhaps most importantly: How can we avoid another incident like this? A security expert breaks down the Trump assassination attempt. Veteran security guardJohn Wightsays deterrence is the most important security principle, and how that principle wasn’t followed. A single footnote and a masterclass in constitutional law. When the Supreme Court decided to grant the former U.S. president and future presidents immunity from prosecution for criminal acts committed as part of the job, but what does that actually mean?Lessig, a Harvard law professor, explains."
