The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can\u2019t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.",
            "Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.",
            "(a)No Representative Actions. You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.",
            "(b)Arbitration of Disputes.Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you\u2019re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a \u201cconsumer\u201d means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.",
            "(c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1,et seq. (the \u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.",
            "(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn\u2019t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.",
            "(e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.",
            "(f)Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim.",
            "(g)You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to trust@medium.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding \u201cGoverning Law and Venue.\u201d",
            "(h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."

        "Governing Law and Venue": [
            "These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles.

As an editor, I\u2019m amazed at the pool of talent abundantly afloat here. I constantly scout for good poetry, prose, and technical articles out there. Only, now I\u2019m being rewarded for that! I\u2019m thrilled that Sri Lanka is finally in the MPP and excited for all my fellow writers for the rewarding scheme this presents. \u2014Viraji Ogodapola, nominator fromThe Howling Owl",

The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.

You and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.",

All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you\u2019re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a \u201cconsumer\u201d means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on theJAMS websiteand are incorporated into these Terms by reference.

(the \u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.",

The arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn\u2019t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.",
            "(e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.",

Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable."

We call this a \u201cwrite-around\u201d \u2014 pick a topic, look some things up, and write around it. Write-arounds can convey information but they typically miss the mark on conveying real understanding.",
            "Over time, we\u2019ve emphasized writer\u2019s experience in our Quality Guidelines, and we\u2019ve noticed that writers are mistakenly trying to check that box, rather than give the spirit of what our readers really want. For example, some writers will include a personal anecdote somewhat related to the topic of the story, followed by a write-around. We also see stories that sprinkle in anecdotes, opinions, \u201cin my experience\u201d phrasing, and other bits that seem to be an attempt to fill this criteria for Boosting. However, the writer doesn\u2019t bring any actual insight into the subject at hand.",

            "Yukon Golds roast a little darker owing to their lower starch content and higher sugar content. This leads to more flavor, but it also means a slightly less crisp crust. Their interiors are nice and creamy, with plenty of flavor.",
            "Red potatoes roast up very dark because of their very low starch content, but have difficulty getting crisp. They come out of the oven crunchy, but soon lose that crunch, turning soft and tender.",
            "Both are well-written and valuable to readers. Both contain personal experience. However, in the first case, the experience offered doesn\u2019t contribute anything to elevate the readers\u2019 understanding of how to make delicious roasted potatoes. In the second case, the reader\u2019s experience goes far deeper: experimenting with different varieties, testing different techniques, and making specific recommendations based on that experience.",
            "The first example is good writing, but it\u2019s not nearly as helpful. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice\u201d is just filler. Insight into the actual differences \u2014 from someone with direct experience of cooking them \u2014 is far more valuable.

As the program has grown, we\u2019ve recognized that the publications that thrive (with high nomination acceptance rates and higher story views) are the ones focused on a topical niche, with a very specific audience in mind.",

A lot of people just avoided using pronouns for me at all. And it was awkward to hear them say my name so many times in a sentence.",
            "Some ally friends said I should stand up for my pronouns, because people ought to respect them. They mean well, but it\u2019s hard for me too to see people struggle with my pronouns or simply avoid them. So I gave up and used he/him.",
